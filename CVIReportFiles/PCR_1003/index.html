                 <h2>Before you read your CVI results…</h2>
				 
				 <p>CVI results can be applied in a number of ways.</p> 

				<p><strong class="qTitle">For Companies</strong> looking to make a hire, evaluate existing teams or ignite leadership, CVI scores showcase the ideal balance of energies needed to feel fulfilled and be highly productive in the work of a given job.  This is done in conjunction with our Top Performer Profile, Human Capital Audit, and Leadership Team Profile tools.  We give leaders the insight they need to run their organization more effectively, reduce turnover and increase revenues.  Hire only guaranteed top performers and reposition existing staff for greater outcomes.
				</p>
				<p><strong class="qTitle">For Executive and Life Coaches</strong>, the CVI helps coaches guide their clients toward a fulfilling career path based on how they are innately wired to contribute. Help clients find work that is a natural expression of who they are.  Improve communication among individuals and entire teams with core-values based training and coaching.  Help everyone understand what they can and cannot expect of themselves and one another.  Increase your value as a coach.
				</p>
				<p><strong class="qTitle">For Individuals</strong>, understand who you are and how you are meant to contribute in the world.  The CVI is frequently reported to provide <i>“the clearest description of myself I’ve ever read.”</i>  Learn the core motivational drivers, unique learning styles, conflict strategies, and communication techniques of yourself and those around you.

             <h2>Core Values and Contribution Types</b></h2>
                <p>Immediately following an upgrade, you will be provided with all of your scores in each of the core values in the quadrant graphic shown above.</p>
                <p>The Core Values Index&trade; (CVI&trade;) creates an accurate picture of each person's core values. The CVI quadrants describe how each person aligns with one of the corresponding core values: Builder, Merchant, Innovator, and Banker. The score in each quadrant indicates the relative strength of that core value compared to the other quadrants.</p>
                <p>In addition, you will be provided with the additional level of insight gained by considering how the core values work in combination with each other. These are referred to as Contribution Types, and these help a person understand how their core values affect their behaviors and actions.</p>

                <h2>Where I Tend to be Vulnerable, and Why</h2>
                <p>Let's face it, everyone has their weak spots. We all deal with undermining thoughts, occasional slips of logic, and ineffective behavioral responses. Those moments are embarrassing, ineffective and sometimes even destructive to ourselves and others.</p>
                <p>These mistakes are the "Achilles Heel" of our most dominant Core Value Energies - the dark side, if you will, of our most precious and important human energy. This may not be the most fun topic for any of us, but it is one that can help you master your own life and create your greatest contribution. </p>
                <p>This section is immediately made available following an upgrade.</p>
                <a class="toTop" href="#congrats">Back to Top ^</a>

	            </div>
	            <h2>Core Values Learning Styles&trade;</h2>
               <p>Following an upgrade, you will be provided with the learning styles for all four core values.</p>
               <p>Once we understand a person’s core values, we gain great insight into the learning styles of that individual. Everyone has the ability to educate themselves on some level within each learning style, but you know that it's easier and more enjoyable to learn lessons in harmony with your primary learning style as opposed to trying to learn in a way that doesn't feel natural to you. </p>
               <p>When lessons are given in a manner that is contrary to a person's innate learning style, the work of learning is difficult, boring and irritating. Learning takes far too much energy, and the information and wisdom disappear as soon as the lesson is ended.</p>

	            </div>
	            <h2>Conflict Strategies</h2>
                <p>Each core value has a specific negative conflict strategy. A Builder's defense mechanism is intimidation; a Merchant's strategy is manipulation; Innovators will interrogate; Bankers fall back on aloof judgment. Upgrade now to discover how you can effectively diffuse your knee-jerk conflict strategy for each of the Core Values, and you'll gain a deep understanding of what each negative conflict strategy looks like. We give clear examples, so you can recognize the escalation and manage the situation in the best interests of yourself, your colleague, spouse, friend, etc.</p>

                    The secret is not to learn how to have fun and joy at work; the secret is to do
                    work that is naturally engaging to <em>who you are</em> and <em>what you are</em>,
                    so you know that you are making your highest and best contribution. This allows
                    you to experience real joy naturally as part of your work-life. This is what Abraham
                    Maslow called "peak experiences." Sometimes this makes the <em>right job</em> downright
                    fun.

                            stories and examples and business results that illustrate the cost of putting people

                        <li>Stories of people who have spent years in wrong occupations, but now have a job
                            that fits their deepest nature; the difference this has made for these people, for
                            their families and for their employers.</li>
                        <li>We will help you understand what your Real Core Values Nature&trade; is, and how
                            it affects the way you feel about your job. How does this Real Core Values Self&trade;
                            affect your ability and willingness to perform the tasks you are now required to
                            perform?</li>

        <h3>The Art of
            Intimidation</h3>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <i><span>Intimidation</span></i><span
           > is an effective defense
            mechanism because it catches people off guard, makes them feel overwhelmed and threatened.
            The energy coming from the <i>intimidator</i> is an order of magnitude greater that
            what is normally expected in a given situation—especially for persons whose <i>power
                core value</i> is relatively low. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <i><span>Intimidation</span></i><span
           > tends to work immediately.
            Then it comes back to haunt the <i>intimidator</i>, because others harbor ill will,
            and use their alternative defense mechanism to defuse the <i>intimidation</i> strategy.
            Also, <i>intimidation</i> works best when people are face to face—on the phone is
            second in line for positional advantage, then written <i>intimidation</i>. Once
            people have the ability to hang up the phone, or tear up the letter (delete the
            email) the strategic advantages of <i>intimidation</i> are made somewhat impotent.</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Part of the potency
            of intimidation comes from an overt use of shame and blame toward others. The power
            based person whose is resorting to <i>intimidation</i> will try to make his behavior
            completely justifiable by pointing the shame and blame finger at others. This is
            the nature of the <i>power</i>-person’s victim position. The victim posture is another
            social strategy that is owned by all four core value strategies. They each put a
            different face on their victim persona.</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Another price paid
            by a person who occasionally or commonly uses <i>intimidation</i> is the loss of
            the ability to use clean appropriate <i>power</i> strategies. Since <i>intimidation</i>
            is a fear-based<i> power</i> strategy, persons who have been the target of <i>intimidation</i>
            or have witnessed the use of <i>intimidation</i> with others, will hold back, avoid
            confrontation, and avoid close proximity with the <i>intimidator</i>. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Now, every act of
            <i>power</i> can be interpreted as part of the <i>intimidators</i> arsenal of attack.
            Many people begin to resist, avoid and redirect the <i>power</i> based persons efforts
            to put his/her personal energy into work and cause others to work hard with or for
            him.</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Once <i>intimidation</i>
            has been exercised in a group with any frequency, others begin to see that the <i>intimidation</i>
            is not all that fearful, and they begin to assume at the subconscious level, that
            they don’t need to respond to directives, commands, or stated expectations, until
            the <i>power</i> based person escalates into the <i>intimidation</i> mode. Then
            everyone jumps to attention and works furiously—until the <i>intimidator</i> leaves.
            Then every one sags back into a slightly less productive mode than existed before
            this latest round of <i>intimidation.</i></span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>People who do not
            use <i>intimidation</i> as a strategy, even when in a state of fear, are often at
            a loss about how to deal with someone who is using <i>intimidation</i>. That’s why
            it works—<i>intimidation</i> comes as a surprise, and the level of emotional, psychological
            energy is so great it causes people to instinctively back away and give in.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Also, many people
            are suckers for accepting blame and shame from others. Some are willing to accept
            the anger and hostility of intimidation, because they continue to believe that they
            may have been the legitimate cause of the other person’s emotional outburst.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoBodyText" style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>The <i>manipulation</i>
            strategy is effective because most people assume that the people around them have
            a good degree of integrity. The expectation is that what another person says is
            basically true, and that what a person appears to be wanting or trying to do is
            the whole and recognizable agenda. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>It also works because
            people generally like to be liked, enjoy being an accepted part of a group. <i>Love</i>
            based people who have shifted into the <i>manipulation</i> defense mechanism may
            appear very much like a <i>love</i> based person who is happy, fearless and simply
            being an effective relationship building and relationship nurturing individual.
            This is the art of <i>manipulation</i>—to fool others into believing that the <i>love-</i>
            based person is continuing to act in a <i>loving </i>fashion.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Another side of
            manipulation is to claim the victim posture and cause people around you to see someone
            else as the cause of conflict and hurt feelings. This still keeps the manipulating
            person from appearing unloving, only wounded and undeserving of such disregard and
            abuse.</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>The strategic objectives
            of the <i>manipulation</i> strategy are many and varied, making them difficult to
            understand, track and defuse. When you are the target of a person who is on the
            defensive and using <i>manipulation</i> to regain composure and to get what he wants
            in an indirect fashion, you may find yourself feeling confused. Some talked about
            being slimed, or flattered and used, or suckered by a story that has worked to deflect
            conflict, criticism and disapproval to others. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Finally, you may
            find yourself talking about the past or the future avoiding talk about any criticism,
            measurement of performance, or reality of the current situation. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Part of the manipulator’s
            quiver of arrows consists of exaggeration (lying) and high energy emotionally based
            attempts to excite people into compliance with the manipulator’s agenda. All of
            this is done to make certain the world sees the manipulator as free from faults,
            free from accountability, free from any failure&#9472; a person whose is innocently
            beyond the scope of measurement or responsibility for anything deemed by others
            to be negative in any way. </span>

    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Once in the mode
            of <i>manipulation</i> the use of others through emotional <i>manipulation </i>is
            ordinary and effective—getting others to fight their battles so the <i>manipulators</i>
            can remain outside the fray, and appearing to be a good, happy and wonderful person.</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Once a leader has
            used <i>manipulative</i> tactics within a group with any kind of regularity, his
            word is no longer trusted, as positive. Hopeful statements are guessed to be exaggerations
            and not based in fact, and the recipient devalues displays of overt emotion and
            compliments. In short, the <i>love</i> based person is not seen as a caring person,
            but a user, a liar and a fake. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>The ability to make
            the primary contributions of a <i>love</i> based person is diminished. People are
            reluctant to be inspired by the leader’s vision and goals, when the trust in the
            relationship has been broken. As a result the expected ingredients of success&#9472;
            team spirit, interdependence and sharing&#9472; have been cut off or reduced in
            magnitude by the manipulative acts of a <i>love</i> based person who is experiencing
            fear and acting out old childhood scenarios in a now adult world.</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Others then skeptically

        <i><span>Interrogation</span></i><span

            strategy of a <i>wisdom</i> based person. It is a very effective ploy since it catches
            others off guard, reveals their ignorance or lack of ability to respond glibly.
            The art of <i>interrogation</i> is designed to use <i>wisdom</i>-like strategies
            to strip away any reasonableness from anyone else’s argument, revealing ignorance
            in others and making others appear to be fools. </span>

        <span>Through cutting,
            vindictive questions, the <i>interrogator</i> causes observers to keep their distance
            and remain quiet for fear of undergoing a similar <i>interrogation</i> themselves.
            This tactic also establishes the superiority of the <i>interrogator’s</i> logic
            and reasoning skills, which builds the <i>interrogator’s</i> sense of being in control,
            and makes others fear and admire the cleverness and intelligence of the <i>interrogator.</i>

    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Note: This is not
            the same thing as having people respect and value this one’s wisdom. But the acknowledgement
            of reasoning skills and questioning talent by others is often sufficient to allow

        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>

            this tactic is that often when talking about ideas, a <i>wisdom </i>based person
            will become quite excited about the ideas he is expressing. He may enjoy the parry
            and jab of logical argumentation, getting juice from this mental sport—a form of

            now to hear this positive <i>wisdom</i> based strategy as part of the same cruel,
            offensive <i>interrogation</i> tactic. They will tend to hold back, not venture
            the expression of any but the soundest ideas in open brainstorming sessions. The
            <i>wisdom</i> person is thus cut off from the interactive best thinking of others
            that he needs to fuel his inquiring mind.</span></p>

        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Like the other negative
            conflict strategies, <i>interrogation</i> invites others to become fearful themselves.
            So, the <i>interrogator</i> often excites <i>manipulation</i> in <i>love </i>based
            persons, <i>intimidation</i> in the <i>power </i>people, and <i>aloof judgment</i>
            in <i>knowledg</i>e people. Wisdom people who resort to<i> interrogation</i> invite
            emotional and cruelly <i>interrogation</i> by other <i>wisdom</i> based persons.

        <span>They find themselves
            occasionally revealed as the fool they are so afraid they just might be. This incitement
            of counter-<i>interrogation</i> causes an escalation of the intensity and a deepening
            of the negative, destructive intent. The counter-punching war of two or more <i>interrogating</i>

                font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"'>. When a <i>wisdom</i> based individual (<i>innovator</i>)
                slips hard into <i>interrogatio</i>n it is in defense of a perceived attack. He
                perceives a judgment that his ideas are not being respected or put to good use,
                a belief that some people may be viewing the <i>interrogator</i> as a fool. This
                incites the deeper fear that maybe “I am a Fool.” So the act of <i>interrogation</i>
                is a deflection, throwing the weight of intellect into tearing someone down through
                <i>interrogation</i> rather than providing strategic guidance, solid solutions,
                essential <i>wisdo</i>m. </span>

        <span>Ask a question about
            the intent of the <i>interrogator’s</i> question(s). “What is the most important
            thing that needs to happen right now?” This kind of question will not necessarily
            stop the <i>interrogatio</i>n, but whatever integrity remains in the person underneath
            their fear of being seen as a fool, wants to stop and respond to an honest question.
            It is calling for their true <i>wisdo</i>m to return and re-engage. </span>

    <p style='margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify'>
        <span>This kind of question
            is a surprise. What an <i>interrogator</i> expects is to catch you off guard, put
            you on the defensive and cause you to do and say foolish things, sharpening another
            round of <i>interrogative</i> questions.</span></p>

            through to the deeper person who is hiding behind the interrogative strategy. After
            all, it looks foolish for a knight in armor to raise his sword against his page
            who is holding the reins of the knight’s horse. Like using an atomic bomb against
            people shooting arrows, the interrogative bomber wants to have his interrogation
            appear to be reasonable and justifiable response to the offender’s actions. Since
            the goal of the interrogator is to make others look and feel foolish, this tactic
            of asking about the degree of intent, disarms the interrogator if only for a moment.

            have no intention of becoming defensive, hysterical, or interrogative yourself,
            the interrogator is hard pressed not to answer a reasonable question with a reasonable

        <span>Let’s take a look
            at how and why the posture of <i>aloof judgment</i> puts the <i>knowledge</i> person
            in control of the situation. Let’s take a looks at how it effectively defends against
            slights against <i>knowledge</i>, his information, his expertise, his responsible
            conservative actions and work.</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>First, most of us
            are painfully aware of our own inadequate supply of <i>knowledge</i>, expertise
            and ready information. When another individual demonstrates that he has <i>knowledge</i>
            and expertise that we do not have, we develop instant respect and begin to rely
            upon this person’s judgments and facts. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>When in conflict
            the first reaction of the <i>knowledge</i> based person is to pull back and become
            aloof, inaccessible emotionally, mentally and physically, the first reaction is
            to pursue this person and try to keep them engaged. This failing, the <i>knowledge</i>
            person withholds his <i>knowledge.</i> </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>This negative strategy
            is further enhanced by the reality that the <i>knowledge</i> based person is convinced
            that he has the right facts and answers, that there is injustice in the current
            situation, and that the pronouncement of this <i>judgment</i> is needed to bring
            others to their senses. This declaration of the wrong of others and the right (correctness
            not goodness) of the <i>knowledge </i>based person causes others to step back, secretly
            reviewing the situation to see if they are in the wrong. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>This momentary focus
            away from the <i>aloof judge</i> provides time and conserves emotional and psychic
            energy. Since the <i>aloofness</i> works to stop interaction and reduce the required
            energy of the <i>aloof</i> person, he can outlast all of the other strategies. The
            <i>aloof judge</i> can wait silently, while <i>builders</i> shout, <i>merchant</i>s
            pout, and <i>innovator</i>s re-route. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>The longer a <i>
            knowledge</i> based person withholds his <i>knowledge</i> and remains aloof, the
            more desperate the others on the team become. They instinctively begin seeking him
            out, asking for his expertise and <i>knowledge</i>&#9472; mission accomplished.</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>This tactic also
            serves the desire to avoid conflict, and sets up a passive aggressive tactic that
            can be even more effective when in full bloom. The <i>knowledge</i> person works
            in the background, presenting the truth, as he sees it-- providing proof he is right
            and gathering the forces in a politically astute, low visibility fashion. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Often the <i>knowledge
        </i>person<i> </i>in the negative conflict mode, becomes passively aggressive and is
            able to enlist <i>merchants</i> to whine and sell the <i>banker’s</i> point of view.
            This knowledge person may encourage <i>builders</i> to begin taking action hoping
            the <i>power</i> person will self-destruct. Or the<i> power</i> person may be encouraged
            to force results that align with the <i>banker’s</i> view. He may concurrently encourage
            <i>innovators</i> to develop tactics and processes that will honor the <i>banker’s</i>

    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>What often backfires
            for the <i>aloof judge</i> is that a feeling of resentment develops in other team
            members. Since the withholding of information and the <i>judgin</i>g of others as
            being wrong only happens under a stressful situation, it may become commonly accepted
            that the <i>banker, knowledge</i> based person who resorts to the <i>aloof judgment</i>
            tactic cannot be counted on in a time of crisis. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Others also resent
            being judged and made to seem wrong. They instinctively look for faults in the one
            who has chosen to be, even if only momentarily, the <i>aloof judge</i>. So, the
            severe judgment that the <i>banker</i> uses in times of fear and duress, can become
            the commonly held <i>judgment</i> of others toward him. The best defense is sometimes
            a good offense.</span></p>

        <span>Effective strategies
            for defusing Aloof Judgment</span></h4>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>1. <b><i>Meet accusations
            and withdrawal with a request for information</i></b>. This <i>banker</i> response
            to another <i>knowledge</i> based person’s <i>aloof judgment</i> tactic is very
            effective. As the <i>aloof judge</i> exits, or withholds information, judging others
            around him to be wrong, the composed <i>banker</i> team member simply acknowledges
            that this person has been correct in the past, then requests that the exiting person
            ‘please leave your information so I can review it and understand your position.’
        </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Even though the
            intent of the <i>aloof judge</i> is to withhold information and avoid the conflict,
            this invitation to prove himself right with others (honoring his <i>core</i> <i>value</i>
            of <i>knowledge</i>) is compelling and squelches the urge to exit as rapidly and
            completely as previously intended. The need of the <i>banker</i> to be always seen
            as being appropriate causes the <i>aloof judge</i> to hesitate and to be enticed
            into delivering his <i>knowledge</i> as requested. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>If he withholds
            his information after being acknowledged as someone who is often right, and after
            being told his information will be used to determine the right in the situation,
            it is almost impossible for the <i>aloof judge</i> to hold to his chosen fear-induced
            strategy. </span>
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Also, since the
            request is coming from a like spirit, another <i>knowledge</i> based person who
            generally acts appropriately and avoids open conflict, there is nothing to fight
            against in the acknowledgment and request. There is an opportunity to develop a
            political ally in defense of the <i>aloof judge’s</i> position. A bravura performance
            for the quietly perceptive fellow <i>banker</i>.</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>2. <b><i>Include
            reliance upon Knowledge as a key to obtaining the team Vision</i></b>. The effective
            <i>merchant,</i> working from a <i>love</i>-based position will enjoy acknowledging
            the importance of a conservative, <i>knowledgeable</i> team member and will paint
            a positive picture about the current <i>aloof judge</i> as a reliable contributor
            to the team. The essential nature of the <i>knowledge</i> based person’s participation
            will develop a base for the <i>aloof judge</i> to let go of his need to withhold
            information and withdraw.</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>This act of acknowledgment
            must not be emotional or have any scent of exaggeration. There can be no urge to
            act or seduction to change thinking. The exchange has to be above reproach, high
            integrity&#9472; done in this manner, with the real desire to connect with the <i>knowledge</i>
            person’s <i>Spiritual Core Value</i>&#9472; the need to resort to <i>aloof judgment</i>
            will be eradicated.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style='text-align: justify'>
        <span>Any vision put up
            as worthy of the <i>knowledge</i> person’s expertise and information must, by its
            nature be a just and fair organization, the people respected and worthy of the gift
            of <i>knowledge</i>. There should also be a clear picture of the mission of the
            team, and the essential materials, supplies, resources that will make the mission
            a success. The magnitude of the mission, the availability and importance of the
            resources—provide the <i>knowledge</i> person with the motivation to invest their
            life energy in conservation of resources and guidance of the team with the <i>knowledge</i>
            in this leader’s possession. Lastly, but with immeasurable importance is the requirement
            that the mission and the team will by their nature, and in the normal course of
            fulfillment of their purpose generate significant new information, new expertise
            for the <i>knowledge</i> person, new knowledge that can be put to use in an even
            greater mission.</span></p>

                response is naturally a <i>power</i> based tactic. That’s what makes him a <i>builder</i>.
                So the application of <i>power</i> into the effort to defuse <i>aloof judgment</i>
                must simultaneously honor the <i>core value</i> of the <i>knowledge</i> person.
                This is done while also staying true to the <i>Core Value</i>—<i>power</i>. This
                is not difficult, once understood.</span></p>
    <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
    <p style='margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify'>
        <b><i><span>Examples:
        </span></i></b><span><i>
            The builder response cannot be a threat or a command. It must be a statement of
            intuitive fact. “I can’t do this thing without someone watching my back, protecting
            our resources and keeping me on track.” This acknowledgment of the power person’s
            need for expertise, knowledge and a responsible keeper of the resources is a strong
            seduction to give up the aloof judgment tactic. The call to deliver support to a
            powerful person who is going to cause significant things to happen is what the knowledge

        <span>Again, the integrity
            of this statement must be absolute. The <i>power</i> person cannot be perceived
            as commanding, or intimidating the <i>knowledg</i>e person into compliance. So,
            there needs to be a pause that allows the aloof judge to put down his defenses on
            his own and take up the responsibilities being put forth. The call to action can
            be a clear statement of requirement. “John, I need that report first thing in the
            morning. Whatever I have in front of me then will be the basis of my decision, and
            the reason for the actions I take.”</span></p>

            that the information will be used to make an important decision—even if some hard

            to their society. When taking control they revert to <i>manipulative judgment</i>,
            or <i>judgmental manipulation</i>. When a positive contribution is the aim, this
            strategic value-based response to situations will appear as development of rules,
            publishing of policies, informative reports and meetings, and constant team building
            activities. <i>Collective Resourcefulness.</i> When control is the aim, these strategies
            revert to whining and passive aggression, politicking behind the scenes, accusations
            of injustice/unfairness, shaming and blaming others, and denial of culpability for
            anything that is wrong or bad. </span>

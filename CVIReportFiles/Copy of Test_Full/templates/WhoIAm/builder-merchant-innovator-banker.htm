<p>Your dominant <strong class="qTitle">Builder</strong> value energy is  balanced by your <strong class="qTitle">Merchant</strong> secondary value energy. Your actions are routinely, almost  equally, guided by these two core energies. In times of distress you will  usually rely on the conflict strategies of your dominant <em>core energy</em>. In less critical conflicts you may use either conflict  strategy given the situation.</p>
<h3>Your unique dominant <strong class="qTitle">BUILDER</strong> Core Energies  causes you to rely upon the following strategies for success and fulfillment.</h3>
<p>Your cornerstone <em>core value</em> is <em>power</em>, the application of pure energy  for Good. This primary driver is supported by a strong faith in your own  ability to know what to do, your faith that your actions are for the Good, and  your faith that once you create change, you will know what to do next. </p>

<h3>BUILDERS-Your Dominant Core Energy</h3>
<p>If you want something to get done in a business,  make sure you give it to a <em>builder.  Builders</em> are the &quot;doers&quot; of the world; a significant percentage  of entrepreneurs and business leaders are <em>builders</em> and without them, little would get accomplished. If you are a <em>builder</em>, you are successful because you  get things done. You know how to take action and get results. You take personal  responsibility. You don't usually make excuses, and you are generally impatient  with those that do. You make decisions on the fly and like it that way. Your  focus is short term and driven by the sense of accomplishment in the moment. </p>
<p><em>Builders</em> have an  internal drive that allows them to be decisive, to blow through obstacles and  make decisions instantly and without hesitation. They are constantly turning  their energies loose on an identified goal, and are not willing to accept  defeat, at least not gracefully. The <em>builder's</em> drive is to see a problem and fix it immediately. They are not great problem  solvers. They expect their energy and their work to be the solution. </p>
<p><em>Builders</em> are powerful  people. They act from their gut and trust their own judgment explicitly. This  makes them very decisive. This can be very intimidating to others. In fact,  intimidation is often inherently the <em>builder's</em> primary way of getting control in any situation. If the sheer power of their  personality and decisiveness is not sufficient to maintain control, they may  resort to anger or hostility. When a builder is out of control, intimidation is  an effective tool to reclaim authority. </p>
<p><em>Builders</em> can take the  vision of <em>merchants</em>, the solutions of <em>innovators</em>, the information of <em>bankers</em>, and put it all into action. <em>Builders</em> have the <em>power</em> to make it happen. </p>
<p>It is obvious why <em>builders</em> make good business leaders. <em>Bankers, merchants</em> and <em>innovators</em> who have strong secondary builder characteristics also succeed very well. </p>
<h3>Builder Challenges</h3>
<p>The first weakness of <em>builder</em> leaders is that they tend to do  everything themselves. They are not effective at teaching others because they  are too impatient<em>. Builders</em> are so  focused on getting things done right now that they typically create an  environment of crisis. They thrive as firefighters, which is useful, since  their style of management may create one fire after another. </p>
<p>Because of the apparent strength of <em>builders,</em> others tend to not stand up  against them, especially when <em>the builder</em> is the boss. Secretaries and bookkeepers are running many small companies, or  even departments in large corporations, because the <em>builder</em> strategies of these employees are allowed to exert  inappropriate control. </p>
<p><em>Builders </em>are not highly  tuned toward reading the reactions and needs of others humans. <em>Builders </em>are not great team players nor  do their strengths lie in building a team. If a <em>builder</em> is good at this, he is using the <em>merchant</em> (relationship) strategy or the <em>innovator</em> (solution) strategy to accomplish the team building  &quot;project.&quot; <em>Builders</em> approach team building the way they approach any project or daily task -- get  started, get moving, get on with it, and don't wait for someone to motivate you  to do it. </p>
<p><em>Builders</em> value action  and results above all other business factors. Their mode of teaching others is  to push people out of the way, take the business tool in their own hands, and  say, &quot;Just watch me do it.&quot; They then leave and expect their  &quot;student&quot; to be as proficient at the task as the <em>builder</em>. This often leaves the student feeling inadequate and  leaves the <em>builder</em> confused as to why  this is the case. If <em>builders</em> can  understand that their mode of teaching may not be the best for the job, more  often than not, wasted energy and confusion can be avoided on both sides. <em>Builders</em> often confuse taking an action  with getting a result. Although they tend to be very pragmatic people and  bottom line oriented, when it comes to their own performance, they are so  focused on taking action that they often forget what their mission is. They  sometimes lose sight of their objectives in the heat of the moment. </p>
<p>Taking an action feels just as good to <em>builders</em> as completing a project. Given  a command to get something done is a &quot;result&quot; for a <em>builder</em>. They have experienced their  energy, enjoyed the work, and feel charged with new energy ready for the next  task. They tend to overlook detail and often place less importance with  results. They view too much information as an affront to their capabilities and  are impatient with <em>innovators</em> who  spend too long reasoning out a situation. They may also see <em>merchants</em> as unreliable. </p>
<p><em>Builders</em> are impatient  with the world and particularly with <em>bankers,  merchants</em> and <em>innovators</em>. In  other words, no one else's values or considerations are as important to a <em>builder</em> as his own when he is after a  specific result or simply wants to take action. </p>
<p>Time is always paramount to a <em>builder</em>. Because <em>builders</em> consider <em>merchants </em>&quot;light-weights&quot;  and &quot;flakes,&quot; and because <em>merchants</em> value relationships so highly, <em>builders</em> are not good at motivating them. This often leads the <em>builder</em> to believe the <em>merchant</em> is wasting his valuable time. </p>
<p><em>Builders</em> also have a low  tolerance for giving instructions. They are so motivated and self-sufficient  that such instruction feels like a waste. Besides, they don't know how to tell  anyone how to do anything. They would rather get it done themselves. </p>
<p><em>Builders </em>enjoy <em>innovators</em> immensely as long as the <em>builder</em> is boss. <em>Innovator</em>s give <em>builders</em> solutions  to problems, and builders are the best implementers around. This relationship  feeds the <em>builder's</em> personal needs  very well. </p>
<p>Blowing relationships up is a pastime  of immature <em>builders</em> and has no more  importance to them than blowing up ideas or disrupting systems that are too  comfortable, or just commanding obedience to see if it can be obtained. Since <em>bankers</em> are averse to risk, want to know  facts before proceeding, and hesitate with every decision, <em>builders</em> see <em>bankers</em> as  brick walls that regularly need to be pushed out of the way and consigned to  the &quot;Back Forty.&quot;</p>
<p><em></p>
<p>  Builders</em> like action, activity, and energy, and they may sacrifice  relationships, effectiveness, and stability to justify the end result they  crave. </p>
<h3>Builder/Merchants</h3>
<p><em>Builder/merchants</em> are  project oriented, team-based, results driven, and commanding yet lovable  people. When the situation calls for someone who will roll up his sleeves and  get to work while always keeping high quality relationships and the long-term  vision in mind, a <em>builder/merchant </em>has  the best <em>core energy</em> for the job. If  decisiveness, energy, heart, enthusiasm, strength, openness, and spontaneity  are also required, the <em>builder/merchant</em> is unbeatable. </p>
<p>These people know how to work and how  to get others to work with them. The <em>builder</em> in them is a doer. If there is too much work for one person, the <em>merchant</em> in them will motivate and teach  others to join in and perform well. This valuable combination of action aligned  with vision, training, results, and solid relationships create an irresistible  force. </p>
<p>Their vision creates excitement while  their action creates worth. Their teaching releases new energy and expands  capabilities while their decisiveness generates bottom line results. Their care  for relationships builds trust and loyalty even as their practicality demands  respect. Their creativity builds appreciation and value. </p>
<p><em>Builder/merchants</em> are  not great in isolation; they need people around. The <em>builder</em> side requires someone to show and command while the <em>merchant</em> side needs an audience and  someone with whom to share the vision and all related successes and failures.  Merchants also like to teach vision and worth (which for them is part of their  monument building) and continuously strive to build quality relationships that  in turn will create new and ongoing relationships. </p>
<p>If building a team rapidly is required,  if opening a new sales territory is the task at hand, or if a new business  enterprise is being launched, a <em>builder/merchant</em> is the most likely candidate to succeed. </p>
<p>However, <em>builder/merchants</em> tend to believe their own point of view and too  easily fall in <em>love</em> with their own  ideas. They may take dramatic actions that can leave a trail of quick starts,  failures and disappointment behind them. They create an incredibly fallow field  for <em>innovators</em> to play in and an  endless vacuum of fact and balance for a <em>banker</em> to set straight. <em>Builder/merchants</em> can  sometimes seem like two persons in one. One moment they are cajoling and joking  and inspiring, then without batting an eye, switch to blustering dynamos of  demand. &quot;Just do it,&quot; they command. </p>
<p>A <em>builder/merchant</em> is prone to make a quick decision and set a course of action. Then, when  challenged by his team, he may deny responsibility, change his mind, set a new  course of action, charge the team with a requirement for results, and take off  on a new idea all within the course of a few sentences and without missing a  beat. </p>
<p>These people are explosive and exciting  to be around. But, if you have a weak heart, you might want to avoid them the  way people with pacemakers avoid microwaves. A strong <em>builder/merchant</em> is good at getting you to do things you don't like  to do and make you believe you're happy doing it. <em>Builder/merchants</em> are the ultimate motivators. </p>

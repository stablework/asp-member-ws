You like to act in accordance with specific {\i knowledge} and historic evidence. Having the right information is important to you. Building protection against possible risk comes naturally. You work diligently to gather resources together and save them. Life is easier when people and things are reasonably similar. Chaos is your enemy. People and situations should measure up to commitments. Once started, you don't give up easily. Creation without effective written plans and process description is senseless. You believe in measurement and in the presentation of measurement and data as an effective leadership tool. Having all of the information is important to you, even the small things. Social structure and appropriate mannerisms are good for the soul. You tend to believe that an appropriate request from you should be all that is required. Effective decisions are supported by analysis of similarities and differences. You care deeply when situations or the behaviors of people are unfair, or when your {\i knowledge} is used incorrectly by others. Zero wasted motion, zero wasted resources, zero wasted effort; this is what you strive for. You like to provide others with proven ideas and methodology. You are a constant force in your world.\par
\par
You strive for exacting control of action and words. You like to be the one who {\i knows}; being right and being able to prove it is important to you. \par

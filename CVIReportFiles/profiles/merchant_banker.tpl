Merchants tend to be exceptional team builders. They motivate people, are constantly excited by new ideas, and never ask if something is possible. They assume every idea is a possibility.  In fact, just having an idea is cause for celebration and reward as far as Merchants are concerned. They believe that nothing happens without a good idea.\par
\par
The power of Merchants comes from their willingness to think about, consider and expose one good thought after the next. They think as they speak, changing and modifying their vision in real time. Since every business is a constantly changing organism, Merchants are invaluable resources.\par
\par
Their excitement is infectious, and people work better when they feel energized. Unlike Builders, Merchants get little satisfaction from feeling their own considerable energy. Merchants thrive on infecting the world around them with excitement toward the common vision. They not only create teams, they also inspire, motivate and direct teams toward real (and sometimes imagined) opportunities.\par
\par
Merchants also have an appreciation for culture, art, literature, quality of presentation, and aesthetics. Without the Merchant mind involved in a business, the workplace can become an abyss of chaotic Builder dictates on scratch pads, Banker spreadsheets and reports, or Innovator block diagrams and technical manuals.\par
\par
Merchants attract others to them, an invaluable asset in business.\par
\par
Merchants sell. Whether they are involved in sales as a business function or not, Merchants sell as much to themselves as to anyone else. Merchants take care of their friends and customers. They nurture long-term relationships. In fact, they tend to value relationships more than results.\par
\par
An entrepreneur or business leader who is predominately a Merchant will generate incredible energy and get almost instant rewards. They can't live without some sort of reward (personal feedback, money, or idea validation) for long.  But, the rewards tend to come from many diverse directions and seldom relate to the Merchant's own long-term vision. A Merchant is perfectly willing to revise his long-term vision as often as required, even more often than necessary.\par
\par
Merchants get results, but usually indirectly. Merchants are the ones who help others see opportunity.  Merchants primarily see opportunities that aren't quite there. Merchants like to start something new as often as possible. They finish projects because they don't want to disappoint someone, not because they themselves value completion and results. Being in the game is what feels good to a Merchant.\par
\par
Business leaders who are predominantly Merchants tend to build well-diversified companies. There are very few opportunities that get by them. Without a Banker sitting on their shoulder to hold them back, they can be reckless. It also helps Merchants to have some Builder characteristics and some Innovator problem solving and strategizing. Without this balance, they tend to start lots of things, finish very few, and have a great time doing it-though they have little to show for the efforts afterwards.\par
\par
Merchants act from love, act with energy and thrive on excitement. They hate redundancy, especially in their own patterns of activity. They generally like being watched when they are performing, visioning, teaching, or inspiring, but they dislike being measured, evaluated, tested, or critiqued.\par
\par
Because Merchants value vision and relationships above all else, they see the future when others are stuck in the past or in a present crisis.  They know how to sell their vision to others and create tremendous energy by exciting others with their ideas. And, contrary to the opinion of Builders, Merchants tend to be quite realistic, deriving most of their vision from extrapolating from today's situation.\par
\par
Their extrapolations are inherently loose and without detail, so Bankers also cringe every time the Merchant has a new vision.   But, Innovators love being around a Merchant because Innovators love a new problem to solve or a new solution to explore. They fill in the required systems and steps a Merchant may only dimly see, and then pass on the plan to a Builder.\par
\par
{\b Merchant Challenges}\par
\par
Merchants, however, need to feel their contributions are important and special. They may think too highly of themselves, wanting to believe everyone loves them. If they didn't believe this, they wouldn't get much done. They can be a joy to have around, but they are not driven to complete tasks. They are great starters and weak finishers.  But, without a Builder around to make things happen, and a Banker to keep things from getting out of hand, a strong Merchant will constantly be stirring up more fish than anyone can catch and landing very few of them.\par
\par
Merchants also become easily frustrated and may not take rejection well. Innovators have to constantly help Merchants see a new approach because Merchants tend to think that "being liked" is all that is required. Merchants experience angst when they perceive they are unappreciated.  Almost everything a Builder or Banker does can make a Merchant feel unappreciated.\par
\par
Merchants tend to succeed quite well at building their team, but where they fall short is in giving their team members the power to control the Merchant's whims and need for constant stimulation. In order for Merchant leaders to have a strong company or department, they have to give someone else considerable right and authority to keep the boss in chains. They need to fulfill their requirement for constant newness and stimulation outside the work place. "Get a life," as some would say.\par
\par
Merchants will often be heard saying:\par
	"Come on. Let's go."\par
	"Let's talk."\par
	"We can do it."\par
	"I'll teach you how."\par
	"Let's work it out."\par
	"This is going to make us rich."\par
	"We are going to get a lot of business out of this."\par
	"Why don't we..."\par
	"Wait and see... You'll believe me then."\par
	"What file?"\par
	"What appointment?"\par
	"What report?"\par
	"I thought we did that yesterday."\par
\par
If you succeed in managing a Merchant, it is through obtaining that person's loyalty and their desire to please you for the sake of maintaining their relationship with you.  You may also be able to convince them to be practical by holding out the promise that in the future they will be able to see another of their ideas come into play.\par
\par
When Merchants feel out of control, put upon or undervalued, they have several very effective strategies for getting back into control. They whine, a sound that attracts the attention and sympathy of all other Merchants within earshot. They cajole, manipulate, and hang their heads in shame to make you back off.\par
\par
If all else fails, Merchants exaggerate the opportunity or change the subject from present performance to a vision of the future. If you mistreat them (by their standards), they may judge you to be beneath them. They keep on selling, not allowing others to speak. They look innocent, talk innocent, and are drawn to anyone who looks or sounds supportive. They will try to love you to death and win you over because maintaining a relationship is what they hold in the highest value.\par
\par
If that doesn't work, they may try to shame you regarding the way you are treating them, making you look like the "bad guy" in the eyes of all observers. Unhappy Merchants pout until everyone gives in.  They tend to make great martyrs. They know the "Poor Me" dramas of life very well. They are great actors. For example, you can spot the Merchants on a basketball team by their success at getting "charging" violations called on their opponents.\par
\par
{\b Merchant/Bankers}\par
\par
Merchant/Bankers are highly visionary, excited, risk measuring and risk taking people with a hard requirement for information, safety and preservation of resources. They are good team builders and reliable asset managers. The worth of Merchant/Bankers is best seen in situations that require highly technical or profuse knowledge to be disseminated to others or situations in which the demand for risk is high and the need for detail and follow-through extreme. Merchants handle risk very well, and Bankers are always considering how they will survive catastrophe. Merchant/Bankers, therefore, are able to play the edge of risk better then any other value set and survive the experience.\par
\par
Since the Merchant impulse is to dream and head toward a brighter future, the balance in the Merchant/Banker can be an immense asset. The Banker nature will constantly be looking for ways to assure longevity, survivability, and cash strength.  The Merchant's inspired activity will be modulated to a more rational set of activities by the Banker mind, making this value set one which sets many things in motion, completing all of them to near perfection.\par
\par
The Merchant/Banker's capacity to keep many balls in the air and to develop unmatched staying power assures these persons of staying at play longer than others, being able to go after more opportunities and have something to show for it in the long haul.\par
\par
When long-term relationships and long-term results are the desired outcome, a Merchant/Banker in leadership will provide maximum assurance of a positive outcome.\par
\par
On the other hand, Merchants/Bankers are also prone to a "dual personality" of sorts, which can show up in different ways in different situations. When they shift into their Merchant role, they are charming, visionary and full of energy. They can often be a surprise to people around them in business because they often bury their Merchant characteristics for fear of being perceived as unprofessional.\par
\par
Another way this "dual personality" occurs is when Merchants/Bankers make announcements about plans and visions on one day and come back the next as their own worst enemy as the Banker in them plays the role of devil's advocate. This sends no small amount of confusion into the team. Merchants/Bankers tend to be impatient to get things moving, but then direct everyone around them to satisfy the Banker's need for having total information and validation. They may come up with great ideas, but they sabotage them constantly with their own demand to have perfect proof of application.\par
\par
Cliff, the idiosyncratic storyteller on the sitcom Cheers is a good example of a poorly performing Merchant/Banker. He has gleaned and garnered thousands of bits of information, some highly interesting, and thrown them in with a million bits of fact that no one else cares about. Then his Merchant takes over and demands the spotlight, displaying his knowledge as though on stage, seeking to entertain and impress the multitudes. He is the epitome of a Merchant/Banker at his least impressive.\par
\par
Merchant/Bankers tend to be angry or indecisive one day and solicitous and caring the next.   Anger comes from the Banker who expects perfection in implementation, and solicitation comes from the Merchant who doesn't want to look like an angry person for fear that all of his friends may go away.   Merchant/Bankers are fun to watch from a distance, but often difficult to work or live with.

The power of Bankers is in their clear rational processes.  They are organized to the nth degree. Data is at their fingertips, and they don't miss details.  Bankers are insatiable information gatherers.  They are like magnets dragged through sand, collecting all the valuable shards of fact.\par
\par
The power of a Banker as a business leader comes from the Banker's intolerance of waste and distaste for unnecessary risk.  Once a Banker is placed into a high-risk situation where resources are limited, his drive to get back into a secure position may cause the Banker to rely more heavily on the Merchants, Innovators or Builders around him. This drive to create something solid and resistant to outside pressures makes a successful Banker's company recession-proof, highly resilient, and seldom under-capitalized.\par
 \par
Bankers who are acting out of their strengths are invaluable.  Without a Banker value set in any sales department, production shop, or marketing office, the number of repetitive mistakes buries the business. Opportunities are lost, orders are misplaced and forgotten, and shipment schedules are considered a nuisance.  Bankers are unwilling to be part of an operation that doesn't fulfill its commitments. They will do almost anything to make things right.\par
\par
Once gathered, the information is ordered, assimilated and re-produced in a manner that leaves nothing out. Because all details are critical to Bankers, they are not good at setting priorities, and instead, become sources of information for others that wish to explore their library-like minds.\par
\par
Bankers are committed to assuring that whatever is done is done successfully. They are adamant about not launching the ship before its sea-worthiness has been tested. Whenever I ride in an airplane, I am thankful for the Banker minds in the FAA. When I take pills to help recover from an illness, I appreciate the Banker minds in the FDA.\par
\par
It is those same Banker minds in the FAA and FDA that so frustrate businesses that want to launch their products.\par
\par
Without Banker influence in any situation, actions are taken without sufficient thought, and directions are changed without considering long-term ramifications or bottom-line consequences.  New innovations are often put into play without regard to service problems, system failures and customer satisfaction.\par
\par
Bankers, more than any of the other value sets, tend to find themselves standing alone, unwaveringly holding their position in order to effect their most important purposes -- to conserve resources, insure longevity, and stabilize the business or society they are in. The analytical power of a Banker far exceeds that of any of the other value sets.\par
\par
When serious problems arise, a Banker becomes an essential resource. He has collected information by sheer will and desire and is able to deliver this information in a clear and balanced form.  A Banker will take the solutions presented by an Innovator and formulate the solution down to the task level, understanding the interrelationship of all elements.\par
\par
The final answers that come from a Banker are solid. They are a long time coming, but when they do arrive, they are above reproach.\par
\par
{\b Banker Challenges}\par
\par
Bankers frustrate Builders. The results-oriented decisiveness of a Builder is the opposite of a Banker's mentality.  Bankers also frustrate Merchants, but more Merchants frustrate them. The constant stirring up of opportunity, the typical lack of value of Merchants on completion of projects, and the lack of concern for details keeps Bankers constantly feeling under informed and off balance. This generally leaves Bankers feeling dismayed and frustrated.\par
\par
Bankers get along quite well with Innovators since Innovators have a high level of regard and need for the information which Bankers have.  Since information and solutions fit together nicely, Bankers serve Innovators well by providing much needed analysis and amassed information, which keeps the Innovator on track.  This, in turn, leaves the Innovator feeling confident of the solutions being implemented.\par
\par
Bankers have the hardest time as entrepreneurs. This is because they are most effective in an environment that needs management of complex, effective systems, and that requires balance and information. In the early stages of company development, until a company reaches $5 to $10 million in annual sales, Bankers tend to overuse their organizational and managerial skills.  What are otherwise considered their strengths can, in fact, also become their weaknesses.\par
\par
A Banker who has strong Merchant characteristics, strong Innovator, or Builder traits can succeed admirably as a leader in a new enterprise. They must be willing, however, to keep their own dominant Banker trait in check until there is truly a need for it in the business.\par
\par
Since Bankers are like Builders in their inattention to team building, they often try to manage their companies or their departments far too long. They are detail-oriented people, concerned with knowing where everything is and if it is in its proper place and functioning to its full capability.  Preservation of an excellent status quo is more important to them than creation. The role of an entrepreneur is to create something out of nothing. For the most part, this is a complete antithesis of a Banker's natural inclination.\par
\par
Bankers, just like any other value set, must have strong partners or employees who provide the creative energy, the sales, the team building, and the drive to get results. Their difficulty lies in admitting it.  Bankers are prone to build an empire of supporters who, like themselves, gather, analyze and report information. They are generally appropriate and considerate bosses, but this is significantly different than the team building activities of a Merchant.\par
\par
Bankers' strengths lie in knowing that all of the information is accurate and available at their fingertips whenever needed.  A Banker is reluctant to make a decision except by omission or delay. Bankers are good at saying "no", which is a trait many people do not possess.  It is important, however, that they do not put situations at risk to avoid their general discomfort with moving forward when the situation calls for it.  This is usually understood by the other value sets and is considered one of their strengths.  When a Banker gets pressed, pushed to the wall, forced to make a decision or act against his analytical conclusions, he may simply disengage. Bankers who feel unduly pressured may judge others as being wrong and withdraw their trust. They may withhold information to regain control. They may also use that information to undermine others when the opportunity arises.  This would be considered a weakness within this value set.\par
\par
Because they dislike conflict, Bankers will occasionally make promises they do not intend to keep. They may simply say a flat, unqualified "no" to everything, hoping that this simple act will be powerful enough to cause others to draw back and surrender. When Bankers feel out of control, they may become aloof, untouchable, unreasonable, intractable, non-responsive, unavailable, busy, etc., due to what they perceive as an inordinate amount of unjustified pressure.\par
\par
Bankers generally outlast Builders, Merchants, and Innovators in a fight because they refuse to invest any energy in the battle until everyone else is exhausted. Their staying power, often considered strength, may also be a weakness when used at an inappropriate time.\par
Some of the things you will hear Bankers say:\par
\par
	"No.  It can't be done."\par
	"Get out of my face (space)."\par
	"Go ahead, if you really have to."\par
	"I told you..."\par
	"I'm studying that right now."\par
	"Not with my money."\par
	"We've never done it that way before."\par
	"Even if we succeed, it won't be enough."\par
\par
Bankers have extraordinary staying power. Their compulsion to be right or to be seen as being right does not allow them to easily admit failure. They keep trying, keep doing, and keep analyzing until often, by perseverance alone, they succeed where others would have failed long before.\par
\par
{\b Banker/Merchants}\par
\par
Banker/Merchants are formal, cautious, knowledgeable, and friendly visionaries.  The worth of Banker/Merchants is best seen in situations that require highly technical or profuse knowledge to be disseminated to others or in which the demand for risk is high and the need for detail and follow-through extreme. Merchants handle risk very well, and Bankers are always considering how they will survive catastrophe. Banker/Merchants, therefore, are able to play the edge of risk better then any other value set and survive the experience.\par
\par
Since the Merchant impulse is to dream and head toward a brighter future, the balance in the Banker/Merchant can be an immense asset. The Banker nature will constantly be looking for ways to assure longevity, survivability and cash strength.  The Merchant's inspired activity will be modulated to a more rational set of activities by the Banker mind, making this value set one that puts many things in motion, completing them all to near perfection.\par
\par
The Banker/Merchant's capacity to keep many balls in the air and to develop unmatched staying power assures these persons of staying at play longer than others.  It also allows them to go after more opportunities and have something to show for it in the long run.\par
\par
When long-term relationships and long-term results are the desired outcome, a Banker/Merchant in leadership will provide maximum assurance of a positive outcome.\par
\par
On the other hand, Banker/Merchants are also prone to a "dual personality" of sorts, which can show up in different ways in different situations. When they shift into their Merchant role, they are charming, imaginative, and full of energy. They can often be a surprise to people in business since they sometimes bury their Merchant characteristics for fear of being perceived as "soft" or unprofessional.\par
\par
Another way this "dual personality" occurs is when Banker/Merchants make announcements about plans and visions on one day and come back the next as their own worst enemy as the Banker in them plays the role of devil's advocate. This causes no small amount of confusion among the team. Banker/Merchants tend to be impatient to get things moving, but then direct others around them to satisfy the Banker's need for having total information and validation. They may come up with great ideas, but they also may sabotage the ideas with their own demand to have perfect proof of application.\par
\par
Cliff, the idiosyncratic storyteller on the sitcom Cheers is a good example of a poorly performing Banker/Merchant. He has gleaned and garnered thousands of bits of information, some highly interesting, and thrown them in with a million bits of fact that no one else cares about. Then his Merchant takes over and demands the spotlight, displaying his knowledge as though on stage, seeking to entertain and impress the multitudes. He is the epitome of a Banker/Merchant at his worst.\par
\par
Banker/Merchants tend to be angry or indecisive one day and solicitous the next, inspiring creativity and harmony.  Anger comes from the Banker who expects perfection in implementation.  Solicitation comes from the Merchant who doesn't want to look like an angry person; for fear that all of his friends may go away.

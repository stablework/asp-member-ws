{\b How to Interview a Builder/Innovator}\par
\par
Builder/Innovators are the most independent of all value profiles. They can quickly figure things out and get to work. They are driven to start on complete short term tasks. They like to demonstrate their personal power and their wisdom. They tend to be tenacious with good energy. These people can be hard to manage because they like to be self directed.\par
\par
Builder/Innovators are not good team builders because they so much enjoy their autonomy. They can be productive team members, but watch for an unwillingness to conform. They don't like to report in or to be supervised. If you need a self-starter with personal pride in completed tasks, these people are unbeatable.\par
\par
Builder/Innovators switch back an forth between hard energetic work (preferably physical or with tangible results) and isolated thinking, assessment and planning. When driven to personal accomplishment they can be or appear to be abrupt and over-powering. When focused on finding a solution, they may appear to be cool and remote, or irritable if interrupted. Watch for a willingness to be stopped by authority. Watch for a willingness to meet time commitments, especially for the Innovator assignments.\par

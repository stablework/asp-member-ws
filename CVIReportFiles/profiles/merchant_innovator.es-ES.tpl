{\i Love people} tend to be exceptional team builders. They motivate people, are constantly excited by new ideas, and never ask if something is possible. They assume every idea is a possibility.  In fact, just having an idea is cause for celebration and reward as far as {\i love people} are concerned. They believe that nothing happens without a good idea.\par
\par
The power of {\i love people} comes from their willingness to think about, consider and expose one good thought after the next. They think as they speak, changing and modifying their vision in real time. Since every business is a constantly changing organism, {\i love people} are invaluable resources.\par
\par
Their excitement is infectious, and people work better when they feel energized. Unlike {\i power people}, {\i love people} get little satisfaction from feeling their own considerable energy. {\i Love people} thrive on infecting the world around them with excitement toward the common vision. They not only create teams, they also inspire, motivate and direct teams toward real (and sometimes imagined) opportunities.\par
\par
{\i Love people} also have an appreciation for culture, art, literature, quality of presentation, and aesthetics. Without the {\i love person's} mind involved in a business, the workplace can become an abyss of chaotic {\i power person} dictates on scratch pads, {\i knowledge person} spreadsheets and reports, or {\i wisdom person} block diagrams and technical manuals.\par
\par
{\i Love people} attract others to them, an invaluable asset in business.\par
\par
{\i Love people} sell. Whether or not they are involved in sales as a business function, {\i love people} sell as much to themselves as to anyone else. {\i Love people} take care of their friends and customers. They nurture long-term relationships. In fact, they tend to value relationships more than results.\par
\par
An entrepreneur or business leader who is predominately a {\i love person} will generate incredible energy and get almost instant rewards. They can't live without some sort of reward (personal feedback, money, or idea validation) for long.  But, the rewards tend to come from many diverse directions and seldom relate to the {\i love person's} own long-term vision. A {\i love person} is perfectly willing to revise his long-term vision as often as required, even more often than necessary.\par
\par
{\i Love people} get results, but usually indirectly. {\i Love people} are the ones who help others see opportunity.  {\i Love people} primarily see opportunities that aren't quite there. {\i Love people} like to start something new as often as possible. They finish projects because they don't want to disappoint someone, not because they themselves value completion and results. Being in the game is what feels good to a {\i love person}.\par
\par
Business leaders who are predominantly {\i love people} tend to build well-diversified companies. There are very few opportunities that get by them. Without a {\i knowledge person} sitting on their shoulder to hold them back, they can be reckless. It also helps {\i love people} to have some {\i power person's} characteristics and some {\i wisdom person's} problem solving and strategizing. Without this balance, they tend to start lots of things, finish very few, and have a great time doing it-though they have little to show for the efforts afterwards.\par
\par
{\i Love people} act from love, act with energy and thrive on excitement. They hate redundancy, especially in their own patterns of activity. They generally like being watched when they are performing, visioning, teaching, or inspiring, but they dislike being measured, evaluated, tested, or critiqued.\par
\par
Because {\i love people} value vision and relationships above all else, they see the future when others are stuck in the past or in a present crisis.  They know how to sell their vision to others and create tremendous energy by exciting others with their ideas. And, contrary to the opinion of {\i power people}, {\i love people} tend to be quite realistic, deriving most of their vision from extrapolating from today's situation.\par
\par
Their extrapolations are inherently loose and without detail, so {\i knowledge people} also cringe every time the {\i love person} has a new vision.   But, {\i wisdom people} love being around a {\i love person} because {\i wisdom people} love a new problem to solve or a new solution to explore. They fill in the required systems and steps a {\i love person} may only dimly see, and then pass on the plan to a {\i power person}.\par
\par
{\b Challenges}\par
\par
{\i Love people}, however, need to feel their contributions are important and special. They may think too highly of themselves, wanting to believe everyone loves them. If they didn't believe this, they wouldn't get much done. They can be a joy to have around, but they are not driven to complete tasks. They are great starters and weak finishers.  But, without a {\i power person} around to make things happen, and a {\i knowledge person} to keep things from getting out of hand, a strong {\i love person} will constantly be stirring up more fish than anyone can catch and landing very few of them.\par
\par
{\i Love people} also become easily frustrated and may not take rejection well. {\i Wisdom people} have to constantly help {\i love people} see a new approach because {\i love people} tend to think that "being liked" is all that is required. {\i Love people} experience angst when they perceive they are unappreciated.  Almost everything a {\i power person} or {\i knowledge person} does can make a {\i love person} feel unappreciated.\par
\par
{\i Love people} tend to succeed quite well at building their team, but where they fall short is in giving their team members the power to control the {\i love person's} whims and need for constant stimulation. In order for {\i love leaders} to have a strong company or department, they have to give someone else considerable right and authority to keep the boss in chains. They need to fulfill their requirement for constant newness and stimulation outside the work place. "Get a life," as some would say.\par
\par
{\i Love people} will often be heard saying:\par
	"Come on. Let's go."\par
	"Let's talk."\par
	"We can do it."\par
	"I'll teach you how."\par
	"Let's work it out."\par
	"This is going to make us rich."\par
	"We are going to get a lot of business out of this."\par
	"Why don't we..."\par
	"Wait and see... You'll believe me then."\par
	"What file?"\par
	"What appointment?"\par
	"What report?"\par
	"I thought we did that yesterday."\par
\par
If you succeed in managing a {\i love person}, it is through obtaining that person's loyalty and their desire to please you for the sake of maintaining their relationship with you.  You may also be able to convince them to be practical by holding out the promise that in the future they will be able to see another of their ideas come into play.\par
\par
When {\i love people} feel out of control, put upon or undervalued, they have several very effective strategies for getting back into control. They whine, a sound that attracts the attention and sympathy of all other {\i love people} within earshot. They cajole, manipulate, and hang their heads in shame to make you back off.\par
\par
If all else fails, {\i love people} exaggerate the opportunity or change the subject from present performance to a vision of the future. If you mistreat them (by their standards), they may judge you to be beneath them. They keep on selling, not allowing others to speak. They look innocent, talk innocent, and are drawn to anyone who looks or sounds supportive. They will try to love you to death and win you over because maintaining a relationship is what they hold in the highest value.\par
\par
If that doesn't work, they may try to shame you regarding the way you are treating them, making you look like the "bad guy" in the eyes of all observers. Unhappy {\i love people} pout until everyone gives in.  They tend to make great martyrs. They know the "Poor Me" dramas of life very well. They are great actors. For example, you can spot the {\i love people} on a basketball team by their success at getting "charging" violations called on their opponents.\par
\par
\par
{\b {\i Creative Contributors-- (love/wisdom people)}}\par
\par
{\i Creative contributors} lead with long-term vision combined with creative solutions for all problems. They build teams and systems. The power of a {\i love/wisdom person} derives from his inexhaustible well of creativity. This creates a deep sense of optimism. If the {\i love person's} dream is not being realized, the {\i wisdom person} can kick in and come up with appropriate solutions. When the {\i wisdom person's} solutions do not align perfectly with the {\i love person's} vision, a new vision is deftly formed which encompasses the solutions and systems which the {\i wisdom person} has conceived while still accomplishing all of the basic values foreseen and desired by the {\i love/wisdom person}.\par
\par
This constant creativity makes the {\i love/wisdom person} an invaluable resource in companies where technologies are changing rapidly or competition puts new demands on the marketing and sales systems of the company. {\i Love/wisdom people} are often chosen as sales representatives. They can sell anything because they build relationships, understand their products and know how to make them fit into a broad range of customer needs.\par
\par
{\i Creative contributors} are not put off by any problem of any magnitude. In fact, their sense of personal esteem is often based in the size, oppressiveness and worthiness of the problems they have before them. They look for opportunities to demonstrate their prowess at problem solving or at turning around difficult relationships, which are at risk.\par
\par
{\i Love/wisdom people} like to be needed either for their solutions and technologies or for their humanity, creativity and love. This inescapable urge to be needed drives them to achieve long-term relationships and to develop products and systems, which insure the longevity of the relationships, which are formed.\par
\par
{\i Creative contributors} are go-anywhere, do-anything kinds of people. They are even able to function for extended periods of time in remote, if not somewhat isolated situations, as long as the sense of connection and personal worth is maintained for the {\i love} side of the value set.  For the {\i wisdom person}, the absorption into the problem-solving aspects of any assignment will carry him far, as long as there remains an opportunity to observe others evaluating and appraising his work once it is finished.\par
\par
{\i Creative contributors}, despite their ability to sustain themselves independently, thrive best in a team environment. They are excellent team builders and the best teachers.  They not only are good at planning a curriculum and basing it in logic and reasonableness, but they pay attention to environment, entertainment, energy levels, and motivation while creating exciting and provocative learning situations.\par
\par
A {\i love/wisdom person} can be an incredible sales person or a powerful entrepreneur if he is balanced with just enough {\i power person} characteristics to actually see the job through to the end.\par
\par
However, {\i creative contributors}, unrestrained, can be unproductive for themselves and society. They can get lost in the rapture of exploring big picture considerations.  The {\i love person} is constantly thinking of new possibilities for projects and new adventures, and the {\i wisdom person} thrives on such challenges.\par
\par
{\i Wisdom people} hate to bring the process of problem solving to a close. Solving problems is their highest form of pleasure, arguably valuing this game above sex and movies.  A {\i wisdom/love person} keeps new things coming and everything that was stirred up before "in the works."  If you are a {\i love/wisdom person}, be certain that you surround yourself with high energy {\i power people} who will push you to "get it done," and a few levelheaded {\i knowledge people} who will help ground your ideas by asking "Are you serious?"\par
\par
{\i Creative contributors} are constantly caught up in the seduction of new ideas such as improving people systems. However, this concept and the strategy to create it are more important than the implementation itself to the {\i wisdom} side. \par
\par
{\i Love/wisdom people} may create as much disappointment as they do opportunity. No one wins from working with them for long unless there are significant constraints in place and a strong team of {\i power people} and {\i knowledge people} around them to enforce them. If you are a {\i love/wisdom person} and you are reading this, you must have just a little {\i power person} or {\i knowledge person} in you.  Make sure you nurture that part of yourself or surround yourself with that type of value set personality.\par
\par
As company leaders, {\i love/wisdom people} never quit selling or solving the future. They sell themselves and others even when everyone has already agreed. There may be little attention to detail because the next new idea takes 110% of all energy and things are constantly left up in the air. {\i Love/wisdom people} tend to be able to keep so much energy swirling around them that they attract others.  {\i Power people} and {\i knowledge people} enjoy a symbiotic relationship.

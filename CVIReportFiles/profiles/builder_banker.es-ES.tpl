If you want something to get done in a business, make sure you give it to a {\i power person}.  {\i Power people} are the "doers" of the world; a significant percentage of entrepreneurs and business leaders are {\i power people} and without them, little would get accomplished. If you are a {\i power person}, you are successful because you get things done. You know how to take action and get results. You take personal responsibility. You don't usually make excuses, and you are generally impatient with those that do. You make decisions on the fly and like it that way. Your focus is short term and driven by the sense of accomplishment in the moment.\par
\par
{\i Power people} have an internal drive that allows them to be decisive, to blow through obstacles and make decisions instantly and without hesitation. They are constantly turning their energies loose on an identified goal, and are not willing to accept defeat, at least not gracefully. The {\i power person's} drive is to see a problem and fix it immediately. They are not great problem solvers. They expect their energy and their work to be the solution.\par
\par
{\i Power people} act from their gut and trust their own judgment explicitly. This makes them very decisive.  This can be very intimidating to others. In fact, intimidation is often inherently the {\i power person's} primary way of getting control in any situation. If the sheer power of their personality and decisiveness is not sufficient to maintain control, they may resort to anger or hostility.  When a {\i power person} is out of control, intimidation is an effective tool to reclaim authority.\par
\par
{\i Power people} can take the vision of {\i love people}, the solutions of {\i wisdom people}, the information of {\i knowledge people}, and put it all into action. {\i Power people} have the power to make it happen.\par
\par
It is obvious why {\i power people} make good business leaders.  {\i Knowledge people}, {\i love people} and {\i wisdom people} who have strong secondary {\i power} characteristics also succeed very well.\par
\par
{\b Challenges}\par
\par
The first weakness of {\i power leaders} is that they tend to do everything themselves. They are not effective at teaching others because they are too impatient. {\i Power people} are so focused on getting things done right now that they typically create an environment of crisis. They thrive as firefighters, which is useful, since their style of management may create one fire after another.\par
\par
Because of the apparent strength of {\i power people}, others tend to not stand up against them, especially when the {\i power person} is the boss.  Secretaries and bookkeepers are running many small companies, or even departments in large corporations, because the {\i power} strategies of these employees are allowed to exert inappropriate control.\par
\par
{\i Power people} are not highly tuned toward reading the reactions and needs of others humans. {\i Power people} are not great team players nor do their strengths lie in building a team.  If a {\i power person} is good at this, he is using the {\i love} (relationship) strategy or the {\i wisdom} (solution) strategy to accomplish the team building "project." {\i Power people} approach team building the way they approach any project or daily task -- get started, get moving, get on with it, and don't wait for someone to motivate you to do it.\par
\par
{\i Power people} value action and results above all other business factors. Their mode of teaching others is to push people out of the way, take the business tool in their own hands, and say, "Just watch me do it." They then leave and expect their "student" to be as proficient at the task as the {\i power person}.  This often leaves the student feeling inadequate and leaves the {\i power person} confused as to why this is the case.  If {\i power people} can understand that their mode of teaching may not be the best for the job, more often than not, wasted energy and confusion can be avoided on both sides.  {\i Power people} often confuse taking an action with getting a result. Although they tend to be very pragmatic people and bottom line oriented, when it comes to their own performance, they are so focused on taking action that they often forget what their mission is. They sometimes lose sight of their objectives in the heat of the moment.\par
\par
Taking an action feels just as good to {\i power people} as completing a project. Given a command to get something done is a "result" for a {\i power person}. They have experienced their energy, enjoyed the work, and feel charged with new energy ready for the next task. They tend to overlook detail and often place less importance with results.  They view too much information as an affront to their capabilities and are impatient with {\i wisdom people} who spend too long reasoning out a situation. They may also see {\i love people} as unreliable.\par
\par
{\i Power people} are impatient with the world and particularly with {\i knowledge people}, {\i love people} and {\i wisdom people}. In other words, no one else's values or considerations are as important to a Builder as his own when he is after a specific result or simply wants to take action.\par
\par
Time is always paramount to a {\i power person}. Because {\i power people} consider {\i love people} "light-weights" and "flakes," and because {\i love people} value relationships so highly, {\i power people} are not good at motivating them.  This often leads the {\i power person} to believe the {\i love person} is wasting his valuable time.\par
\par
{\i Power people} also have a low tolerance for giving instructions. They are so motivated and self-sufficient that such instruction feels like a waste. Besides, they don't know how to tell anyone how to do anything. They would rather get it done themselves.\par
\par
{\i Power people} enjoy {\i wisdom people} immensely as long as the {\i power person} is boss. {\i Wisdom people} give {\i power people} solutions to problems, and {\i power people} are the best implementers around. This relationship feeds the {\i power person's} personal needs very well.\par
\par
Blowing relationships up is a pastime of immature {\i power people} and has no more importance to them than blowing up ideas or disrupting systems that are too comfortable, or just commanding obedience to see if it can be obtained. Since {\i knowledge people} are averse to risk, want to know facts before proceeding, and hesitate with every decision, {\i power people} see {\i knowledge people} as brick walls that regularly need to be pushed out of the way and consigned to the "Back Forty."\par
\par
You will often hear a {\i power person} saying things like:\par
	"Just do it."\par
	"Get out of my way."\par
	"I'll do it."\par
	"Not in my house (yard, family, company, department, etc.,)."\par
	"Make it happen."\par
	"I don't care what I said yesterday."\par
\par
{\i Power people} like action, activity, and energy, and they may sacrifice relationships, effectiveness, and stability to justify the end result they crave.\par
\par
{\b {\i Practical Contributors-- (power/knowledge people)}}\par
\par
{\i Practical contributors} are strong-minded, direct, knowledgeable, hard-working, and commanding people. Businesses that require high levels of detail, have a high volume of transactions, or have their basis in technical knowledge must have {\i power/knowledge people} in leadership. The {\i knowledge person's} commitment to thorough knowledge, to being right, to follow-through and to detail is invaluable in these situations. The ability to take appropriate actions and make decisions in the midst of massive data and volumes of statistics and regulations draws on the strengths of the {\i power person}.\par
\par
{\i Practical contributors} are tough people to get around. They are motivated toward excellence and self-assured both in practical results and in legal and moral appropriateness. They tend to set a course and hold to it and do whatever is required to make certain they are able to do so.\par
\par
{\i Practical contributors} take risks that are well considered and backed by sound reason and facts (though not quite as well as {\i knowledge/power people}). {\i Power/knowledge people} take firm leadership in professional service companies such as CPA firms, attorney partnerships and mutual funds.\par
\par
{\i Practical contributors} present themselves as and are often masters in their field. They tend to speak from experience and make demands of others that fit both the person and the situation.\par
\par
When a {\i practical contributors} completes a task, it has usually been completed on time, under-budget and with excellent attention to quality. {\i Power/knowledge people} build efficient, practical, durable, financially solvent operations. They are not willing to do less.\par
\par
On the other hand, {\i power/knowledge people} can be experienced as arrogant people who have a great deal of trouble building a team around them. What the {\i power person} in them is not able to make happen can be immediately explained by the statistics and information generated by the {\i knowledge} side of the value set. These people believe they are rarely wrong.  They have difficulty in valuing {\i love people}.  They may feel the "touchy-feely" approach is a waste of time and are also impatient with {\i wisdom people}. They tend to be erratic. The {\i power person} makes quick decisions, then back-pedals based upon a new understanding of information, usually derived from {\i knowledge person} driven computer files reviewed at home while other people are sleeping.\par
\par
{\i Power/knowledge people} are so certain they are right, they may not bother to gain consensus for their actions or check to see whether anyone else is enjoying the business process. These people can burn the energies of others either through erratic commands or stubborn refusal to make a decision. They are known for sometimes making a decision one day and remaking it the next, each time with a forceful command for unquestioning obedience from the team.\par
\par
{\i Practical contributors} are so self-assured and so unwilling to be wrong that they may overpower others around them. These people are more likely to find a way to "run" the business from second and third level positions than any other value set.\par
\par
When a {\i power/knowledge person} is right in his conclusions, he is a powerful steady force that creates firm and unwavering forward motion. When wrong, the {\i practical contributor} may choose to be a bit overbearing in defending his point of view.  He may view any differing opinion as a direct challenge to his authority rather than seeing a different point of view.   Since he seldom doubts his own conclusions, it is impossible for {\i love people} and {\i wisdom people} to know when to go to battle with the {\i power/knowledge person}. He is so comfortable with his compulsion to act and so certain of his knowledge that he can get away with almost any action he chooses to take.

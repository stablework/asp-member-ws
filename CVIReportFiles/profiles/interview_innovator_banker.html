{\b How To Interview an Innovator/Banker}\par
\par
Innovator/Bankers are very cerebral. They have a strong requirement to think things through and to know all the facts before they make a decision or take an action. Their Innovator drive is to understand the reality of people places and things through thorough assessment, then develop a best response or long term plan. The banker values require this person to gather information and to be able to prove any statement with facts.\par
\par
Innovator/Bankers tend to make decisions slowly, and they don't like to be forced into action, quick decisions or hard time-lines. They design and defend effective systems, but may tend to want to change systems more often than is required. Others may feel Innovator/bankers are arrogant, and Know-It-All. Watch for a sense of humility and patience with others.\par
\par
Explore this person's appreciation for relationships and willingness to work hard. Watch for signs of physical energy vs. a possible lethargic and intentionally slow nature. Try to learn whether this person is open to the ideas and judgments of others.\par

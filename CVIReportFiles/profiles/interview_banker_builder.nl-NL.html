{\b How to Interview a Banker/Builder}\par\par
\par\par
Banker/Builders are pragmatic people, willing to accept reality, measure results and work hard, consistently. Their banker values require them to know the facts, protect resources, avoid risk and keep things organized. Their builder values require quick decisions, action immediate results. These individuals tend to be poor teachers.\par\par
\par\par
Some people are likely to experience the banker/builder as cold and formal, yet occasionally over-powering. Since people skills is not their forte, banker/builders may not be highly tuned to the reactions of others. They are generally not strong team builders. Look for communications skills and willingness to work in concert with others.\par\par
\par\par
Watch for inconsistency-- too conservative one moment and too quick to act at another-too risk averse in one situation, too willing to risk it all in another setting. Depending upon the relative weighting of their banker/builder values, and their personal maturity, these people may be somewhat erratic, making snap decisions and giving commands during the day, checking themselves with their banker values over-night, reversing their commands the next day.\par\par

{\b Here are some questions you may want to ask. }\par\par
\par\par
A. Tell me about your greatest success in organizing a business or situation, protecting and preserving essential resources. How have you built on that experience?\par\par
\par\par
b. Can you remember a time when you carefully organized your resources and set up a system of controls, then by-passed your own system in order to make things happen? Is there someone in your present or past who would accuse you of being inconsistent-too conservative one minute and too impulsive the next?\par\par
\par\par
C. Tell me the most important accomplishment of your career. Was this success created mostly because you were careful and accurate with your knowledge, or because you were willing to take a strong action, putting some important things at risk?\par\par
\par\par
D. When was the last time you found yourself saying "No" without much thought. Would some people label you a "negative" person? What have you learned about yourself that helps you to be open to new information, input from others?\par\par
\par\par
E. On a given day, are you more likely to say "Yes" or "No" more often? How has this tendency helped you? Can you remember a time when this tendency was ineffective?\par\par
\par\par
F. Tell me about a time when one person, or a group of people felt intimidated or controlled by you? Were they able to express their concerns with you? What skills have you developed to encourage team work and open communications?\par\par

G. Tell me about a time when you felt like you had to take care of everything, when details were being lost and important systems dishonored. Is it possible that your sense of what was important was wrong? Were you effective in getting others to cooperate with important requirements?\par\par
\par\par
H. When in the past have you found yourself working on projects that were no longer considered important to the rest of your team? How did you react to this situation?\par\par
\par\par
I. Can you remember a time when you knew that most of the people around you were focused too much on the future and facts about the present circumstances were not being faced.\par\par
\par\par
J. Has there been a situation in your life in which you were the one who held the best vision of the future and were willing to risk more than the people around you? What are you most willing to risk in business situations: Money, prestige, authority, emotional balance, relationships, general resources-other?\par\par

\par\par
L. Can you remember a time when your energy and creativity created a situation that required new systems or processes in order to move forward? How did you make this happen?\par\par
\par\par
M. Have you ever found yourself at a loss for good solutions to real problems? Who did you get to help you?\par\par
			\par\par
N. Tell me about a time when you knew what you wanted or what you wanted to do, but you had difficulty knowing how to achieve your desired goal. How did you solve your dilemma?\par\par
\par\par
O. Can you remember a situation that you were required to control, preserving resources, but there were inadequate systems in place? How did you decide what systems were required? Who helped you design the processes and procedures?\par\par
			\par\par
P. Is there one a situation in your past that was particularly frustrating? Were there people around you that you could count on to support your objectives? What would your team members from that time remember most positively? Would those people jump at the chance to work with you again? If not, what skills have you learned to make you a better team player.\par\par
\par\par
Q. What's the biggest price you ever paid for either not having a good plan, or not following the plan that you created, or was created for you? How have you assured yourself that you will not pay that price again?

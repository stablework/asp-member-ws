{\qj \froman \fs22 {\b Core Values and Personality Types}\par
\par
The {\i Core Values Index (CVI)} creates an accurate picture of each person's core values. The {\i CVI} quadrants describe how each person aligns with one of the corresponding {\i core values}.\par
\par
{\i {\b Core Values:}}\par
 {\i Power}\par
 {\i Love}\par
 {\i Wisdom}\par
 {\i Knowledge}\par
\par
The score in each quadrant indicates a relative strength of that {\i core value} compared to the other quadrants. Generally, a person is strongly inclined toward one {\i core value} strategy with a second {\i core value} strategy also being a very important part of their make-up. In turn, most people have two quadrant scores that are higher and closer together compared to the other two quadrants. The strongest {\i core value} is called the dominant {\i core value}. The next highest {\i core value} is called the secondary {\i core value} and the third highest is called the tertiary {\i core value}.  The lowest scoring {\i core value} is called the minor value.\par
\par
{\b Power People}\par
\par
{\i Power} is the personal energy used to make a difference and create a positive result. This {\i core value} is supported by the catalytic value of {\i faith}. {\i Faith} is the confidence a person has to say, "I know what to do. I know that what I am about to do is right. I will know what to do next." \par

{\i Power people} are a well-respected group of people. They are powerful people who tend to create lasting monuments for themselves and their businesses. {\i Power people} act, make decisions, and drive toward results. They take the aspirations of the {\i love people}, the ideas of the {\i wisdom people}, and the facts from the {\i knowledge people} and through the application of personal energy produce results. {\i Power people} lead by example and by command. Their style is to take immediate action and apply their personal energy to create a desired result.\par
\par
{\b Love People}\par
\par
{\i Love} is the nurturing of {\i Core Values Nature} in one's self and in others. This {\i core value} is supported by the catalytic value of {\i truth}. {\i Truth} is the ability to see the way things are.\par

{\i Love people} are amazing sales people. But more than this, they are the risk-takers, the visionaries, and the traders opening new markets. They see endless possibilities. They foster the pursuit of wealth, art, and beauty. {\i Love people} motivate and inspire {\i power people}, {\i wisdom people} and {\i knowledge people}. {\i Love people} are team builders and deal makers. They lead through {\i love} and excitement. They ask others to help them achieve their unique vision. Their strategy is to attract others to their visions, and to nurture the {\i core values} in others.\par
\par\par
{\b Wisdom People}\par
\par
{\i Wisdom} is the ability to see the way things work and know what to do about it. This {\i core value} is supported by the catalytic value of {\i compassion}. {\i Compassion} is the ability to remain in situations and understand why other people react the way they do.\par

{\i Wisdom people} constantly add to society with their ability to solve problems. They observe and understand situations while striving toward effective solutions. When others around them claim, "It can't be done", {\i wisdom people} come up with a possibility and they ask, "What if?" {\i Wisdom people} keep projects rolling by providing alternative solutions for {\i power people}, {\i love people}, and {\i knowledge people}. {\i Wisdom people} always find a better way. They lead through brainstorming, innovation, strategic thinking, and the provision of effective strategies. They lead by questioning and providing critical answers for critical situations. Their strategy is to hold back, observing everything, and then work towards a personal understanding of a given situation or problem. From this place of understanding, they are able to provide wise solutions and effective strategies.\par
\par
{\b Knowledge People}\par
\par
{\i Knowledge} is the "how" and "why" of things. This {\i core value} is supported by the catalytic value of {\i justice}. {\i Justice} is the fair and equitable way.\par

{\i Knowledge people} gain and preserve the most important {\i knowledge}. They take personal responsibility for collecting and preserving the most important resources of society. They assimilate all available data in their field of endeavor. They organize thought and information to help others be more effective. They challenge the viability of new directions by showing past successes and failures. They keep balance in the system. {\i Knowledge people} keep {\i love people}, {\i power people} and {\i wisdom people} from unreasonable risk. {\i Knowledge people} conserve, analyze and inform. {\i Knowledge people} work hard for justice and appropriate behavior. Their strategy is to constantly gather {\i knowledge}, so that when the time comes, they will have the answer.\par
\par
{\b Core Value Types of Contributors}\par
\par
People operate most of the time from their dominant and secondary {\i core values}. This is where they carry the most emotional commitment to the values, and prescribe how they are geared to generate their successes. However, an additional level of insight can be gained by considering how the {\i core values} work in combination with each other. These combinations are called contributor types. There are six contributor types. Each contributor type is derived from a unique combination of two of the {\i core values}. The contributor types help a person gain more insight concerning how their {\i core values} affect their behaviors and actions. Typically, a person will find themselves described mostly in the dominant/secondary type, but some of the qualities will be found in the other types as well. While each dominant/secondary contributor type has positive strategies that lead to success, each has its own blind spots and weaknesses as well.\par
\par
{\b 1. {\i Intuitive Contributors}: Knowing as an instinct with sharp, eclectic insight.}\par
\tab
The {\i intuitive} contributor type is a combination of the {\i power} and {\i love} {\i core values}. The {\i intuitive} score is derived by adding the {\i power} score and {\i love} score together. The opposite of the {\i intuitive} type is the {\i cognitive} type. {\i Power people} and {\i love people} are both {\i intuitive} in their thinking. {\i Power people} value acting from the gut, from impulse. {\i Love people} are also {\i intuitive} and value acting from {\i love}. Both of these values rely on spontaneity. {\i Intuitive people} tend to act without a lot of thought or second-guessing. They tend to make quick decisions based upon the way things feel and the way they feel about things. They believe in their capacity to know what to do next.\par
\par
{\b 2. {\i Independent Contributors}: Desire and ability to act autonomously, without supervision or significant restraints.}\par
\tab
The {\i independent} contributor type is a combination of the {\i power} and {\i wisdom} {\i core values}. The {\i independent} score is derived by adding the {\i power} score and {\i wisdom} score together. The opposite of the {\i independent} type is the {\i community} type. {\i Wisdom people} and {\i power people} both value monument building. {\i Power people} like to leave monuments demonstrating their powerful presence on earth in brick, stone, and tangible materials. {\i Wisdom people} prefer to leave their monuments in the form of systems, new products, and innovations. {\i Independent people} like to participate in solving problems. The {\i wisdom person} wants to make an assessment and find the right solution, while the {\i power person} instinctively knows what to do and wants to immediately fix the problem. They know how to derive a good strategy from a challenging situation, and they are willing to immediately effect the right actions. Since proof of personal {\i power} and {\i wisdom} is their driver, there is little value placed upon teamwork.\par
\par
{\b 3. {\i Practical Contributors}: Experience, practice, or use rather than theory or speculation.}\par
\tab
The {\i practical} contributor type is a combination of the {\i power} and {\i knowledge} {\i core values}. The {\i practical} score is derived by adding the {\i power} score and the {\i knowledge} score together. The opposite of the {\i practical} type is the {\i creative} type. {\i Power people} and {\i knowledge people} both value "being right". These people think that they are never wrong. {\i Power people} believe they're never wrong because they are acting from the gut, and who can challenge the validity of a gut instinct? {\i Knowledge people} believe they are never wrong because they have the data to back up their actions and conclusions. When a {\i practical person} is right in his conclusions, he is a powerful steady force that creates firm and unwavering forward motion. He will tend to set a course and hold to it, and do whatever is required to make certain they are able to do so.\par
\par
{\b 4. {\i Creative Contributors}: Originality, expression, vision, and imagining what can be.}\par
\tab
The {\i creative contributor} is a combination of the {\i love} and {\i wisdom core values}. The {\i creative} score is derived by adding the {\i love} score and {\i wisdom} score together. The opposite of the {\i creative} type is the {\i practical} type. {\i Love people} and {\i wisdom people} both value being needed, either for their solutions and technologies, or for their humanity, creativity and love. This need to be appreciated drives them to achieve long-term relationships, and to develop products and systems which insure the longevity of the relationships which are formed. The strength of a {\i wisdom/love person} derives from their inexhaustible well of creativity. This creates a deep sense of optimism. If the {\i love person's} dream is not being realized, the {\i wisdom person} can kick in and come up with the appropriate solutions. When the {\i wisdom person's} solutions do not align perfectly with the {\i love person's} vision, a new vision is deftly formed. This new vision can encompass the solutions and systems which the {\i wisdom person} has conceived and still achieve all of the basic values desired by the {\i creative contributor}. \par
\par
{\b 5. {\i Community Contributors}: Belief in teamwork and organizations of individuals as strategic tools for success.}\par
\tab
The {\i community contributor} is a combination of the {\i love} and {\i knowledge core values}. The {\i community} score is derived by adding the {\i love} score and {\i knowledge} score together. The opposite of the {\i community} type is the {\i independent} type of contributor. When long-term relationships and long-term results are the desired outcome, a {\i love/knowledge person} will provide maximum assurance of a positive outcome. The worth of {\i love/knowledge people} is best seen in situations that require highly technical or profuse knowledge that needs to be disseminated to others, or situations in which the demand for risk is high, and the need for detail and follow-through extreme. {\i Love people} handle risk very well and {\i knowledge people} are always considering how they will survive catastrophe. \par
\par
{\b 6. {\i Cognitive Contributors}: Process of faculty of {\i knowledge} and {\i wisdom}-- reasoning.}\par
\tab
The {\i cognitive contributor} is a combination of the {\i wisdom} and {\i knowledge} core values. The {\i cognitive} score is derived by adding the {\i wisdom} score and {\i knowledge} score together. The opposite of the {\i cognitive} type is the {\i intuitive} type. {\i Wisdom people} and {\i knowledge people} both value making decisions based upon assessment and analysis. They make decisions based upon what they think or know versus what they feel. {\i Cognitive contributors} are rationally based, working from fact, provable systems, and logical flow. A person with a strong {\i cognitive} type can rapidly assess a situation, and come up with multiple solutions or systems to support the stated objectives. Once conceived, the ideas are analyzed, organized, proven on paper, and perfected in documentation. \par

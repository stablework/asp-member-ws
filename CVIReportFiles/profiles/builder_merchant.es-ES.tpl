If you want something to get done in a business, make sure you give it to a {\i power person}.  {\i Power people} are the "doers" of the world; a significant percentage of entrepreneurs and business leaders are {\i power people} and without them, little would get accomplished. If you are a {\i power person}, you are successful because you get things done. You know how to take action and get results. You take personal responsibility. You don't usually make excuses, and you are generally impatient with those that do. You make decisions on the fly and like it that way. Your focus is short term and driven by the sense of accomplishment in the moment.\par
\par
{\i Power people} have an internal drive that allows them to be decisive, to blow through obstacles and make decisions instantly and without hesitation. They are constantly turning their energies loose on an identified goal, and are not willing to accept defeat, at least not gracefully. The {\i power person's} drive is to see a problem and fix it immediately. They are not great problem solvers. They expect their energy and their work to be the solution.\par
\par
{\i Power people} act from their gut and trust their own judgment explicitly. This makes them very decisive.  This can be very intimidating to others. In fact, intimidation is often inherently the {\i power person's} primary way of getting control in any situation. If the sheer power of their personality and decisiveness is not sufficient to maintain control, they may resort to anger or hostility.  When a {\i power person} is out of control, intimidation is an effective tool to reclaim authority.\par
\par
{\i Power people} can take the vision of {\i love people}, the solutions of {\i wisdom people}, the information of {\i knowledge people}, and put it all into action. {\i Power people} have the power to make it happen.\par
\par
It is obvious why {\i power people} make good business leaders.  {\i Knowledge people}, {\i love people} and {\i wisdom people} who have strong secondary {\i power} characteristics also succeed very well.\par
\par
{\b Challenges}\par
\par
The first weakness of {\i power leaders} is that they tend to do everything themselves. They are not effective at teaching others because they are too impatient. {\i Power people} are so focused on getting things done right now that they typically create an environment of crisis. They thrive as firefighters, which is useful, since their style of management may create one fire after another.\par
\par
Because of the apparent strength of {\i power people}, others tend to not stand up against them, especially when the {\i power person} is the boss.  Secretaries and bookkeepers are running many small companies, or even departments in large corporations, because the {\i power} strategies of these employees are allowed to exert inappropriate control.\par
\par
{\i Power people} are not highly tuned toward reading the reactions and needs of others humans. {\i Power people} are not great team players nor do their strengths lie in building a team.  If a {\i power person} is good at this, he is using the {\i love} (relationship) strategy or the {\i wisdom} (solution) strategy to accomplish the team building "project." {\i Power people} approach team building the way they approach any project or daily task -- get started, get moving, get on with it, and don't wait for someone to motivate you to do it.\par
\par
{\i Power people} value action and results above all other business factors. Their mode of teaching others is to push people out of the way, take the business tool in their own hands, and say, "Just watch me do it." They then leave and expect their "student" to be as proficient at the task as the {\i power person}.  This often leaves the student feeling inadequate and leaves the {\i power person} confused as to why this is the case.  If {\i power people} can understand that their mode of teaching may not be the best for the job, more often than not, wasted energy and confusion can be avoided on both sides.  {\i Power people} often confuse taking an action with getting a result. Although they tend to be very pragmatic people and bottom line oriented, when it comes to their own performance, they are so focused on taking action that they often forget what their mission is. They sometimes lose sight of their objectives in the heat of the moment.\par
\par
Taking an action feels just as good to {\i power people} as completing a project. Given a command to get something done is a "result" for a {\i power person}. They have experienced their energy, enjoyed the work, and feel charged with new energy ready for the next task. They tend to overlook detail and often place less importance with results.  They view too much information as an affront to their capabilities and are impatient with {\i wisdom people} who spend too long reasoning out a situation. They may also see {\i love people} as unreliable.\par
\par
{\i Power people} are impatient with the world and particularly with {\i knowledge people}, {\i love people} and {\i wisdom people}. In other words, no one else's values or considerations are as important to a Builder as his own when he is after a specific result or simply wants to take action.\par
\par
Time is always paramount to a {\i power person}. Because {\i power people} consider {\i love people} "light-weights" and "flakes," and because {\i love people} value relationships so highly, {\i power people} are not good at motivating them.  This often leads the {\i power person} to believe the {\i love person} is wasting his valuable time.\par
\par
{\i Power people} also have a low tolerance for giving instructions. They are so motivated and self-sufficient that such instruction feels like a waste. Besides, they don't know how to tell anyone how to do anything. They would rather get it done themselves.\par
\par
{\i Power people} enjoy {\i wisdom people} immensely as long as the {\i power person} is boss. {\i Wisdom people} give {\i power people} solutions to problems, and {\i power people} are the best implementers around. This relationship feeds the {\i power person's} personal needs very well.\par
\par
Blowing relationships up is a pastime of immature {\i power people} and has no more importance to them than blowing up ideas or disrupting systems that are too comfortable, or just commanding obedience to see if it can be obtained. Since {\i knowledge people} are averse to risk, want to know facts before proceeding, and hesitate with every decision, {\i power people} see {\i knowledge people} as brick walls that regularly need to be pushed out of the way and consigned to the "Back Forty."\par
\par
You will often hear a {\i power person} saying things like:\par
	"Just do it."\par
	"Get out of my way."\par
	"I'll do it."\par
	"Not in my house (yard, family, company, department, etc.,)."\par
	"Make it happen."\par
	"I don't care what I said yesterday."\par
\par
{\i Power people} like action, activity, and energy, and they may sacrifice relationships, effectiveness, and stability to justify the end result they crave.\par
\par
{\b {\i Intuitive Contributors-- (power/love people)}}\par
\par
{\i Intuitive contributors} are project oriented, team-based, results driven, and commanding yet lovable people. When the situation calls for someone who will role up his sleeves and get to work while always keeping high quality relationships and the long-term vision in mind, a {\i power/love person} has the best value set for the job. If decisiveness, energy, heart, enthusiasm, strength, openness, and spontaneity are also required, the {\i power/love person} is unbeatable.\par
\par
These people know how to work and how to get others to work with them. The {\i power person} in them is a doer.  If there is too much work for one person, the {\i love person} in them will motivate and teach others to join in and perform well. This valuable combination of action aligned with vision, training, results, and solid relationships create an irresistible force.\par
\par
Their vision creates excitement while their action creates worth.  Their teaching releases new energy and expands capabilities while their decisiveness generates bottom line results. Their care for relationships builds trust and loyalty even as their practicality demands respect.  Their creativity builds appreciation and value.\par
\par
{\i Intuitive contributors} are not great in isolation; they need people around.  The {\i power} side requires someone to show and command while the {\i love} side needs an audience and someone with whom to share the vision and all related successes and failures. {\i Love people} also like to teach vision and worth (which for them is part of their monument building) and continuously strive to build quality relationships that in turn will create new and ongoing relationships.\par
\par
If building a team rapidly is required, if opening a new sales territory is the task at hand, or if a new business enterprise is being launched, a {\i power/love person} is the most likely candidate to succeed.\par
\par
However, {\i power/love people} tend to believe their own point of view and too easily fall in love with their own ideas. They may take dramatic actions that can leave a trail of quick starts, failures and disappointment behind them. They create an incredibly fallow field for {\i wisdom people} to play in and an endless vacuum of fact and balance for a {\i knowledge person} to set straight. {\i Power/love people} can sometimes seem like two persons in one. One moment they are cajoling and joking and inspiring, then without batting an eye, switch to blustering dynamos of demand. "Just do it," they command.\par
\par
An {\i Intuitive contributor} is prone to make a quick decision and set a course of action. Then, when challenged by his team, he may deny responsibility, change his mind, set a new course of action, charge the team with a requirement for results, and take off on a new idea all within the course of a few sentences and without missing a beat.\par
\par
These people are explosive and exciting to be around.  But, if you have a weak heart, you might want to avoid them the way people with pacemakers avoid microwaves.  A strong {\i power/love person} is good at getting you to do things you don't like to do and make you believe you're happy doing it.  {\i Power/love people} are the ultimate motivators.

Merchants tend to be exceptional team builders. They motivate people, are constantly excited by new ideas, and never ask if something is possible. They assume every idea is a possibility.  In fact, just having an idea is cause for celebration and reward as far as Merchants are concerned. They believe that nothing happens without a good idea.\par
\par
The power of Merchants comes from their willingness to think about, consider and expose one good thought after the next. They think as they speak, changing and modifying their vision in real time. Since every business is a constantly changing organism, Merchants are invaluable resources.\par
\par
Their excitement is infectious, and people work better when they feel energized. Unlike Builders, Merchants get little satisfaction from feeling their own considerable energy. Merchants thrive on infecting the world around them with excitement toward the common vision. They not only create teams, they also inspire, motivate and direct teams toward real (and sometimes imagined) opportunities.\par
\par
Merchants also have an appreciation for culture, art, literature, quality of presentation, and aesthetics. Without the Merchant mind involved in a business, the workplace can become an abyss of chaotic Builder dictates on scratch pads, Banker spreadsheets and reports, or Innovator block diagrams and technical manuals.\par
\par
Merchants attract others to them, an invaluable asset in business.\par
\par
Merchants sell. Whether or not they are involved in sales as a business function, Merchants sell as much to themselves as to anyone else. Merchants take care of their friends and customers. They nurture long-term relationships. In fact, they tend to value relationships more than results.\par
\par
An entrepreneur or business leader who is predominately a Merchant will generate incredible energy and get almost instant rewards. They can't live without some sort of reward (personal feedback, money, or idea validation) for long.  But, the rewards tend to come from many diverse directions and seldom relate to the Merchant's own long-term vision. A Merchant is perfectly willing to revise his long-term vision as often as required, even more often than necessary.\par
\par
Merchants get results, but usually indirectly. Merchants are the ones who help others see opportunity.  Merchants primarily see opportunities that aren't quite there. Merchants like to start something new as often as possible. They finish projects because they don't want to disappoint someone, not because they themselves value completion and results. Being in the game is what feels good to a Merchant.\par
\par
Business leaders who are predominantly Merchants tend to build well-diversified companies. There are very few opportunities that get by them. Without a Banker sitting on their shoulder to hold them back, they can be reckless. It also helps Merchants to have some Builder characteristics and some Innovator problem solving and strategizing. Without this balance, they tend to start lots of things, finish very few, and have a great time doing it-though they have little to show for the efforts afterwards.\par
\par
Merchants act from love, act with energy and thrive on excitement. They hate redundancy, especially in their own patterns of activity. They generally like being watched when they are performing, visioning, teaching, or inspiring, but they dislike being measured, evaluated, tested, or critiqued.\par
\par
Because Merchants value vision and relationships above all else, they see the future when others are stuck in the past or in a present crisis.  They know how to sell their vision to others and create tremendous energy by exciting others with their ideas. And, contrary to the opinion of Builders, Merchants tend to be quite realistic, deriving most of their vision from extrapolating from today's situation.\par
\par
Their extrapolations are inherently loose and without detail, so Bankers also cringe every time the Merchant has a new vision.   But, Innovators love being around a Merchant because Innovators love a new problem to solve or a new solution to explore. They fill in the required systems and steps a Merchant may only dimly see, and then pass on the plan to a Builder.\par
\par
{\b Merchant Challenges}\par
\par
Merchants, however, need to feel their contributions are important and special. They may think too highly of themselves, wanting to believe everyone loves them. If they didn't believe this, they wouldn't get much done. They can be a joy to have around, but they are not driven to complete tasks. They are great starters and weak finishers.  But, without a Builder around to make things happen, and a Banker to keep things from getting out of hand, a strong Merchant will constantly be stirring up more fish than anyone can catch and landing very few of them.\par
\par
Merchants also become easily frustrated and may not take rejection well. Innovators have to constantly help Merchants see a new approach because Merchants tend to think that "being liked" is all that is required. Merchants experience angst when they perceive they are unappreciated.  Almost everything a Builder or Banker does can make a Merchant feel unappreciated.\par
\par
Merchants tend to succeed quite well at building their team, but where they fall short is in giving their team members the power to control the Merchant's whims and need for constant stimulation. In order for Merchant leaders to have a strong company or department, they have to give someone else considerable right and authority to keep the boss in chains. They need to fulfill their requirement for constant newness and stimulation outside the work place. "Get a life," as some would say.\par
\par
Merchants will often be heard saying:\par
	"Come on. Let's go."\par
	"Let's talk."\par
	"We can do it."\par
	"I'll teach you how."\par
	"Let's work it out."\par
	"This is going to make us rich."\par
	"We are going to get a lot of business out of this."\par
	"Why don't we..."\par
	"Wait and see... You'll believe me then."\par
	"What file?"\par
	"What appointment?"\par
	"What report?"\par
	"I thought we did that yesterday."\par
\par
If you succeed in managing a Merchant, it is through obtaining that person's loyalty and their desire to please you for the sake of maintaining their relationship with you.  You may also be able to convince them to be practical by holding out the promise that in the future they will be able to see another of their ideas come into play.\par
\par
When Merchants feel out of control, put upon or undervalued, they have several very effective strategies for getting back into control. They whine, a sound that attracts the attention and sympathy of all other Merchants within earshot. They cajole, manipulate, and hang their heads in shame to make you back off.\par
\par
If all else fails, Merchants exaggerate the opportunity or change the subject from present performance to a vision of the future. If you mistreat them (by their standards), they may judge you to be beneath them. They keep on selling, not allowing others to speak. They look innocent, talk innocent, and are drawn to anyone who looks or sounds supportive. They will try to love you to death and win you over because maintaining a relationship is what they hold in the highest value.\par
\par
If that doesn't work, they may try to shame you regarding the way you are treating them, making you look like the "bad guy" in the eyes of all observers. Unhappy Merchants pout until everyone gives in.  They tend to make great martyrs. They know the "Poor Me" dramas of life very well. They are great actors. For example, you can spot the Merchants on a basketball team by their success at getting "charging" violations called on their opponents.\par
\par
{\b Merchant/Builders}\par
\par
Merchant/Builders are high energy, excited, spontaneous leaders, remarkably capable of developing teams and getting action through both loyalty and command. When the situation calls for someone who will roll up his sleeves and get to work, always maintaining high quality relationships and the long-term vision in mind, a Merchant/Builder is the best value set for the job. If decisiveness, energy, heart, enthusiasm, strength, openness, and spontaneity are required, the Merchant/Builder is unbeatable.\par
\par
These people know how to work and how to get others to work with them. The Builder in them is a doer, and if there is too much work for one person, the Merchant in them will motivate and teach others to join in and perform well.  This valuable combination of action aligned with vision, training, and solid relationships creates an irresistible force.\par
\par
Their actions create worth while their vision and teaching releases new energy and excitement and expands the capabilities of those around them.  Their decisiveness generates bottom line results, the lynch pin of any company, while their ongoing care for relationships builds trust and loyalty amongst their fellow staff.  Their creativity is a force to be reckoned with and adds appreciation and value to the job at hand.\par
\par
Merchant/Builders are not good in isolation. They need to have people around. The Builder side requires someone to show and command while the Merchant side needs an audience and someone with whom to share the vision and all related successes and failures. Merchants also like to teach.  For them, this is part of their monument building -- the passing along of knowledge and worth and the building of quality relationships that in turn will build more relationships.\par
\par
If rapidly building a team is required, opening a new sales territory is the task at hand, or if a new business enterprise is being launched, a Merchant/Builder is the most likely candidate to succeed.\par
\par
However, Merchant/Builders tend to believe their own worldview and too easily fall in love with their own ideas. They may take dramatic action and leave a trail of disappointment behind them. They create an incredibly fallow field for Innovators to play in and an endless vacuum of fact and balance for a Banker to set straight. Merchant/Builders can sometimes seem inconsistent. One moment they are cajoling and joking and inspiring; then, without batting an eye, they switch to blustering dynamos of demand. "Just do it," they command.\par
\par
A common scene is this: A Merchant/Builder will make a decision and set a course of action. Then, when challenged by his team, she'll deny responsibility, change his mind, set a new course of action, charge the team with a requirement for results, and take off on a new idea all within the course of a few sentences while hardly missing a beat.\par
\par
These people are explosive and exciting to be around, but if you have a weak heart, avoid them the way people with pacemakers avoid microwaves. A strong Merchant/Builder is good at getting you to do things you don't like to do and make you believe you're happy doing it.  This is as much strength as it can be a weakness.

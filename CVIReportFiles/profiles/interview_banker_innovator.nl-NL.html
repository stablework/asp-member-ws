{\b How to Interview a Banker/Innovator}\par
\par
Banker/Innovators are very cerebral. They have a strong requirement to think things through and to know all the facts before they make a decision or take an action. Their banker values require this person to gather information and to be able to prove any statement with facts. Their Innovator drive is to understand the reality of people places and things through thorough assessment, then develop a best response or long term plan.\par
\par
Banker/Innovators tend to make decisions slowly, and they don't like to be forced into action, quick decisions or hard time-lines. They refuse to be rushed to create a less than perfect solution for any business situation. They design and defend effective systems, but may tend to want to change systems more often than is required. Others may feel\par
\par
Banker/Innovators are stubborn, arrogant and Know-It-All. Watch for a sense of humility and patience with others. Explore this person's appreciation for relationships and willingness to work hard. Watch for signs of physical energy vs. a possible lethargic and intentionally slow nature. Try to learn whether this person is open to the ideas and judgments of others. Look for passive aggressive tendencies, or a willingness to withhold information.\par

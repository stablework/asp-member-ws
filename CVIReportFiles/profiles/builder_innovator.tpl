If you want something to get done in a business, make sure you give it to a Builder.  Builders are the "doers" of the world; a significant percentage of entrepreneurs and business leaders are Builders and without them, little would get accomplished. If you are a Builder, you are successful because you get things done. You know how to take action and get results. You take personal responsibility. You don't usually make excuses, and you are generally impatient with those that do. You make decisions on the fly and like it that way. Your focus is short term and driven by the sense of accomplishment in the moment.\par
\par
Builders have an internal drive that allows them to be decisive, to blow through obstacles and make decisions instantly and without hesitation. They are constantly turning their energies loose on an identified goal, and are not willing to accept defeat, at least not gracefully. The Builder's drive is to see a problem and fix it immediately. They are not great problem solvers. They expect their energy and their work to be the solution.\par
\par
Builders are powerful people. They act from their gut and trust their own judgment explicitly. This makes them very decisive.  This can be very intimidating to others. In fact, intimidation is often inherently the Builder's primary way of getting control in any situation. If the sheer power of their personality and decisiveness is not sufficient to maintain control, they may resort to anger or hostility.  When a Builder is out of control, intimidation is an effective tool to reclaim authority.\par
\par
Builders can take the vision of Merchants, the solutions of Innovators, the information of Bankers, and put it all into action. Builders have the power to make it happen.\par
\par
It is obvious why Builders make good business leaders.  Bankers, Merchants and Innovators who have strong secondary Builder characteristics also succeed very well.\par
\par
{\b Builder Challenges}\par
\par
The first weakness of Builder leaders is that they tend to do everything themselves. They are not effective at teaching others because they are too impatient. Builders are so focused on getting things done right now that they typically create an environment of crisis. They thrive as firefighters, which is useful, since their style of management may create one fire after another.\par
\par
Because of the apparent strength of Builders, others tend to not stand up against them, especially when the Builder is the boss.  Secretaries and bookkeepers are running many small companies, or even departments in large corporations, because the Builder strategies of these employees are allowed to exert inappropriate control.\par
\par
Builders are not highly tuned toward reading the reactions and needs of others humans. Builders are not great team players nor do their strengths lie in building a team.  If a Builder is good at this, he is using the Merchant (relationship) strategy or the Innovator (solution) strategy to accomplish the team building "project." Builders approach team building the way they approach any project or daily task -- get started, get moving, get on with it, and don't wait for someone to motivate you to do it.\par
\par
Builders value action and results above all other business factors. Their mode of teaching others is to push people out of the way, take the business tool in their own hands, and say, "Just watch me do it." They then leave and expect their "student" to be as proficient at the task as the Builder.  This often leaves the student feeling inadequate and leaves the Builder confused as to why this is the case.  If Builders can understand that their mode of teaching may not be the best for the job, more often than not, wasted energy and confusion can be avoided on both sides.  Builders often confuse taking an action with getting a result. Although they tend to be very pragmatic people and bottom line oriented, when it comes to their own performance, they are so focused on taking action that they often forget what their mission is. They sometimes lose sight of their objectives in the heat of the moment.\par
\par
Taking an action feels just as good to Builders as completing a project. Given a command to get something done is a "result" for a Builder. They have experienced their energy, enjoyed the work, and feel charged with new energy ready for the next task. They tend to overlook detail and often place less importance with results.  They view too much information as an affront to their capabilities and are impatient with Innovators who spend too long reasoning out a situation. They may also see Merchants as unreliable.\par
\par
Builders are impatient with the world and particularly with Bankers, Merchants and Innovators. In other words, no one else's values or considerations are as important to a Builder as his own when he is after a specific result or simply wants to take action.\par
\par
Time is always paramount to a Builder. Because Builders consider Merchants "light-weights" and "flakes," and because Merchants value relationships so highly, Builders are not good at motivating them.  This often leads the Builder to believe the Merchant is wasting his valuable time.\par
\par
Builders also have a low tolerance for giving instructions. They are so motivated and self-sufficient that such instruction feels like a waste. Besides, they don't know how to tell anyone how to do anything. They would rather get it done themselves.\par
\par
Builders enjoy Innovators immensely as long as the Builder is boss. Innovators give Builders solutions to problems, and Builders are the best implementers around. This relationship feeds the Builder's personal needs very well.\par
\par
Blowing relationships up is a pastime of immature Builders and has no more importance to them than blowing up ideas or disrupting systems that are too comfortable, or just commanding obedience to see if it can be obtained. Since Bankers are averse to risk, want to know facts before proceeding, and hesitate with every decision, Builders see Bankers as brick walls that regularly need to be pushed out of the way and consigned to the "Back Forty."\par
\par
You will often hear a Builder saying things like:\par
	"Just do it."\par
	"Get out of my way."\par
	"I'll do it."\par
	"Not in my house (yard, family, company, department, etc.,)."\par
	"Make it happen."\par
	"I don't care what I said yesterday."\par
\par
Builders like action, activity, and energy, and they may sacrifice relationships, effectiveness, and stability to justify the end result they crave.\par
\par
{\b Builder/Innovators}\par
\par
Builder/Innovators are action-oriented, solution driven and independent people. Business situations that require lasting structures or systems to be built must have a Builder/Innovator power at the helm. Whether the requirement is to make something that is complex simple, or to take a simple system and make it more robust and responsive to current needs, the Builder/Innovator is the person for the job.\par
\par
Builder/Innovators conceive appropriate solutions and take immediate action. Implementing a solution to a problem is a rich form of reward for the Builder and seeing a system put into effect is the highest acknowledgment for an Innovator. So, in the Builder/Innovator, we have a person who designs a monument and then builds it.\par
\par
These powerful personalities are good in isolation. They thrive on independence and chaff under someone else's management. If given a general idea of the problem to be solved, or the monument to build, they will find a way to get it done.  But, give them their head and stand back. Without an open range to work in, their energy turns from creativity and action to clever evasion of restrictions, invisibility and possibly, even anger.\par
\par
Builder/Innovators are not intimidated by much of anything except intimate relationships and speaking to crowds. They are resourceful, agile, constantly in motion, clever, inventive, able to teach others (Innovator), and powerful in commanding a situation to bring about its desired effect (Builder). They derive their own solutions and put them into action without hesitation.\par
\par
In quickly changing environments, failing situations, and extreme growth opportunities, Builder/Innovators are unmatched.\par
\par
Builder/Innovators believe they have the answer to every question and the power to do anything. Their Innovator value set develops one irrefutably valid solution after the next, and the Builder in them either pushes everyone out of the way while they implement the plan, or they direct someone else in the same manner on how to get the job done expediently.  In other words, if they can't do it themselves, they still expect it to be done exactly as they would have carried out the assignment.\par
\par
Since Builders are impatient with the world, they may consider any teaching time to be "baby-sitting." Builder/Innovators are convinced they are self-sufficient. Since they are impatient, they also may find it difficult to be tutored and may feel their ideas are the only ones with any real merit.

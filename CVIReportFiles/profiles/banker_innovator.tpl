The power of Bankers is in their clear rational processes.  They are organized to the nth degree. Data is at their fingertips, and they don't miss details.  Bankers are insatiable information gatherers.  They are like magnets dragged through sand, collecting all the valuable shards of fact.\par
\par
The power of a Banker as a business leader comes from the Banker's intolerance of waste and distaste for unnecessary risk.  Once a Banker is placed into a high-risk situation where resources are limited, his drive to get back into a secure position may cause the Banker to rely more heavily on the Merchants, Innovators or Builders around him. This drive to create something solid and resistant to outside pressures makes a successful Banker's company recession-proof, highly resilient, and seldom under-capitalized.\par
 \par
Bankers who are acting out of their strengths are invaluable.  Without a Banker value set in any sales department, production shop, or marketing office, the number of repetitive mistakes buries the business. Opportunities are lost, orders are misplaced and forgotten, and shipment schedules are considered a nuisance.  Bankers are unwilling to be part of an operation that doesn't fulfill its commitments. They will do almost anything to make things right.\par
\par
Once gathered, the information is ordered, assimilated and re-produced in a manner that leaves nothing out. Because all details are critical to Bankers, they are not good at setting priorities, and instead, become sources of information for others that wish to explore their library-like minds.\par
\par
Bankers are committed to assuring that whatever is done is done successfully. They are adamant about not launching the ship before its sea-worthiness has been tested. Whenever I ride in an airplane, I am thankful for the Banker minds in the FAA. When I take pills to help recover from an illness, I appreciate the Banker minds in the FDA.\par
\par
It is those same Banker minds in the FAA and FDA that so frustrate businesses that want to launch their products.\par
\par
Without Banker influence in any situation, actions are taken without sufficient thought, and directions are changed without considering long-term ramifications or bottom-line consequences.  New innovations are often put into play without regard to service problems, system failures and customer satisfaction.\par
\par
Bankers, more than any of the other value sets, tend to find themselves standing alone, unwaveringly holding their position in order to effect their most important purposes -- to conserve resources, insure longevity, and stabilize the business or society they are in. The analytical power of a Banker far exceeds that of any of the other value sets.\par
\par
When serious problems arise, a Banker becomes an essential resource. He has collected information by sheer will and desire and is able to deliver this information in a clear and balanced form.  A Banker will take the solutions presented by an Innovator and formulate the solution down to the task level, understanding the interrelationship of all elements.\par
\par
The final answers that come from a Banker are solid. They are a long time coming, but when they do arrive, they are above reproach.\par
\par
{\b Banker Challenges}\par
\par
Bankers frustrate Builders. The results-oriented decisiveness of a Builder is the opposite of a Banker's mentality.  Bankers also frustrate Merchants but more typically Merchants frustrate them. The constant stirring up of opportunity, the typical lack of value of Merchants on completion of projects, and the lack of concern for details keeps Bankers constantly feeling under informed and off balance. This generally leaves Bankers feeling dismayed and frustrated.\par
\par
Bankers get along quite well with Innovators since Innovators have a high level of regard and need for the information which Bankers have.  Since information and solutions fit together nicely, Bankers serve Innovators well by providing much needed analysis and amassed information, which keeps the Innovator on track.  This, in turn, leaves the Innovator feeling confident of the solutions being implemented.\par
\par
Bankers have the hardest time as entrepreneurs. This is because they are most effective in an environment that needs management of complex, effective systems, and that requires balance and information. In the early stages of company development, until a company reaches $5 to $10 million in annual sales, Bankers tend to overuse their organizational and managerial skills.  What are otherwise considered their strengths can, in fact, also become their weaknesses.\par
\par
A Banker who has strong Merchant characteristics, strong Innovator, or Builder traits can succeed admirably as a leader in a new enterprise. They must be willing, however, to keep their own dominant Banker trait in check until there is truly a need for it in the business.\par
\par
Since Bankers are like Builders in their inattention to team building, they often try to manage their companies or their departments far too long. They are detail-oriented people, concerned with knowing where everything is and if it is in its proper place and functioning to its full capability.  Preservation of an excellent status quo is more important to them than creation. The role of an entrepreneur is to create something out of nothing. For the most part, this is a complete antithesis of a Banker's natural inclination.\par
\par
Bankers, just like any other value set, must have strong partners or employees who provide the creative energy, the sales, the team building, and the drive to get results. Their difficulty lies in admitting it.  Bankers are prone to build an empire of supporters who, like themselves, gather, analyze and report information. They are generally appropriate and considerate bosses, but this is significantly different than the team building activities of a Merchant.\par
\par
Bankers' strengths lie in knowing that all of the information is accurate and available at their fingertips whenever needed.  A Banker is reluctant to make a decision except by omission or delay. Bankers are good at saying "no", which is a trait many people do not possess.  It is important, however, that they do not put situations at risk to avoid their general discomfort with moving forward when the situation calls for it.  This is usually understood by the other value sets and is considered one of their strengths.  When a Banker gets pressed, pushed to the wall, forced to make a decision or act against his analytical conclusions, he may simply disengage. Bankers who feel unduly pressured may judge others as being wrong and withdraw their trust. They may withhold information to regain control. They may also use that information to undermine others when the opportunity arises.  This would be considered a weakness within this value set.\par
\par
Because they dislike conflict, Bankers will occasionally make promises they do not intend to keep. They may simply say a flat, unqualified "no" to everything, hoping that this simple act will be powerful enough to cause others to draw back and surrender. When Bankers feel out of control, they may become aloof, untouchable, unreasonable, intractable, non-responsive, unavailable, busy, etc., due to what they perceive as an inordinate amount of unjustified pressure.\par
\par
Bankers generally outlast Builders, Merchants, and Innovators in a fight because they refuse to invest any energy in the battle until everyone else is exhausted. Their staying power, often considered strength, may also be a weakness when used at an inappropriate time.\par
Some of the things you will hear Bankers say:\par
\par
	"No.  It can't be done."\par
	"Get out of my face (space)."\par
	"Go ahead, if you really have to."\par
	"I told you..."\par
	"I'm studying that right now."\par
	"Not with my money."\par
	"We've never done it that way before."\par
	"Even if we succeed, it won't be enough."\par
\par
Bankers have extraordinary staying power. Their compulsion to be right or to be seen as being right does not allow them to easily admit failure. They keep trying, keep doing, and keep analyzing until often, by perseverance alone, they succeed where others would have failed long before.\par
\par
{\b Banker/Innovators}\par
\par
Banker/Innovators are generally quiet, knowledgeable, resourceful, self-directed and steady people. Any business that needs creative solutions in a highly demanding, practical situation will appreciate the contributions of a Banker/Innovator. When the situation calls for reduction of good concepts to design and then the further reduction to documentation and quality control, the Banker/Innovator becomes irreplaceable.\par
\par
Banker/Innovators are rationally based, working from fact, provable systems and logical flow. This value set can rapidly assess a situation and come up with multiple solutions or systems to support the stated objectives. Once conceived, the ideas are analyzed, organized, proven on paper and perfected in documentation.\par
\par
The power of Banker/Innovators in areas of product or system design echoes the strengths of the Merchant/Banker in risky business situations. The Banker/Innovator is prone to carefully push the technological or systems horizons.  The Innovator struggles to create the best possible end product, while for the Banker, half of the value set is constantly worrying about the details, picking up the unfinished and unresolved design flaws, challenging each step before and after it occurs, and assuring maximum likelihood of success.\par
\par
Because of their Banker side, Banker/Innovators will come up with true innovations that actually work. There is nothing more valuable to an engineering design team than unlimited innovation balanced by the ability to design such an innovation to perfection and ending up with documentation that carries all the way through production, testing and quality assurance.\par
\par
It is likely that Banker/Innovators developed Calls and Puts in the stock brokerage arena. This is a prime example of innovation for the sake of risk reduction.\par
\par
Banker/Innovators, however, have a difficult time making decisions. Saying "no" without thought is not making a decision. Information provides evidence to create new solutions, and new solutions need proof, which can only be derived from further information, making the process loop endless. If you are a Banker/Innovator and the president of a company (or head of a department), then your way to success is through attracting Merchants and Builders with strong enough personalities to act on their own authority and not wait for you to make a decision. They also must be willing to tell you that some of the information you believe you "need" is not needed in order to get things done.\par
\par
When Banker/Innovators go into their "no decision today" lock-up, there is little hope of getting them out of it. The Innovator side gets stubborn and isolates from others until "I can figure this out," and the Banker side sets into motion a protracted data gathering and analysis cycle which "only I can manage." This posture is virtually impenetrable, unless a courageous Builder simply puts himself at risk and takes unauthorized action, and a Merchant stays in the resulting fracas to help resolve relationships and keep everyone focused on the corporate goals.  Spontaneity for a Banker/Innovator is not a proposition for him.  Recognizing this as a weakness can help the Banker/Innovator surround himself with Merchants and Builders.

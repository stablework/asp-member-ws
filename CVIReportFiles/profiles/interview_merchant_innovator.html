{\b How To Interview a Merchant/Innovator}\par
\par
Merchant/Innovators tend to be highly creative people, relationship and solutions driven-- spontaneous action with a long-term focus with a good ability to prioritize daily activities. They are spontaneous and tenacious workers. Watch for lack of organization, unwillingness to perform repetitive tasks, emotional outbursts with periods of isolation, lack of appreciation for perfect information and hard measurable results.\par
\par
These individuals are good teachers. They love to think things through, developing complex logic and talking with their friends. They require constant newness-New assignments, new ideas, new opportunities, new problems to solve. They tend to enlarge every idea that comes to them and make things complex. They don't like to be told how to behave, and they dislike hard timelines-it spoils their sense of creativity.\par
\par
Watch for the shift between their Merchant (let's be friends) values and their Innovator (let me figure it out) values. The Merchant values lead them into group activities. Their Innovator values lead them into self-directed isolation while they think things through especially if there is conflict.\par
\par
Watch for honesty related to past accomplishments. Explore this individual's willingness to remain in conflict. Merchant/Innovators are so relationship driven and clever in their private thoughts, they may find ways to make you like them while they create an environment that resists clean measurement.\par

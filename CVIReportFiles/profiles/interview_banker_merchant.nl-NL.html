{\b How to Interview a Banker/Merchant}\par
\par
Banker/Merchants are very adept socially with a banker's formality and appropriateness and a Merchant's warmth and charm. They are extraordinary in their ability to learn everything from technical to human development and emotional intelligence. These people pride themselves on their knowledge, their practical approach and their vision of the future.\par
\par
because their banker energy conserves energy and resources they are uniquely prepared to take on any new opportunities their Merchant values may uncover. They test and prove likelihood of success and position themselves for success well in advance. Yet they are spontaneous in their actions and socially gregarious at times. They are good team builders.\par
\par
Banker/Merchants may appear and actually erratic at times, being cool and unemotional for long periods, yet suddenly flashing with overt caring and charisma. When a person experiences the Merchant values first in these individuals, they may feel set up and disappointed by a conservative force and a negative response to new ideas, coming from the protective and thoughtful banker values. Watch for a tendency to judge others harshly or to claim a victim position in situations.\par
\par
Since bankers and Merchants tend to avoid conflict, these people can be passive aggressive, finding ways to politic behind the scenes with solid facts and figures and with a whining charm that draws people in. If banker/Merchants choose to act out they are generally very capable of undermining an organization, stalling forward motion and gaining control through background political tactics.\par

The strength of {\i knowledge people} is in their clear rational processes.  They are organized to the nth degree. Data is at their fingertips, and they don't miss details.  {\i Knowledge people} are insatiable information gatherers.  They are like magnets dragged through sand, collecting all the valuable shards of fact.\par
\par
The strength of a {\i knowledge person} as a business leader comes from the {\i knowledge person's} intolerance of waste and distaste for unnecessary risk.  Once a {\i knowledge person} is placed into a high-risk situation where resources are limited, his drive to get back into a secure position may cause the {\i knowledge person} to rely more heavily on the {\i love people}, {\i wisdom people} or {\i power people} around him. This drive to create something solid and resistant to outside pressures makes a successful {\i knowledge person's} company recession-proof, highly resilient, and seldom under-capitalized.\par
 \par
{\i Knowledge people} who are acting out of their strengths are invaluable.  Without a {\i knowledge person} value set in any sales department, production shop, or marketing office, the number of repetitive mistakes buries the business. Opportunities are lost, orders are misplaced and forgotten, and shipment schedules are considered a nuisance.  {\i Knowledge people} are unwilling to be part of an operation that doesn't fulfill its commitments. They will do almost anything to make things right.\par
\par
Once gathered, the information is ordered, assimilated and reproduced in a manner that leaves nothing out. Because all details are critical to {\i knowledge people}, they are not good at setting priorities, and instead, become sources of information for others that wish to explore their library-like minds.\par
\par
{\i Knowledge people} are committed to assuring that whatever is done is done successfully. They are adamant about not launching the ship before its sea-worthiness has been tested. Whenever I ride in an airplane, I am thankful for the {\i knowledge person} minds in the FAA. When I take medications to help recover from an illness, I appreciate the {\i knowledge person} minds in the FDA.\par
\par
It is those same {\i knowledge person} minds in the FAA and FDA that so frustrate businesses that want to launch their products.\par
\par
Without a {\i knowledge person's} influence in any situation, actions are taken without sufficient thought, and directions are changed without considering long-term ramifications or bottom-line consequences.  New innovations are often put into play without regard to service problems, system failures and customer satisfaction.\par
\par
{\i Knowledge people}, more than any of the other value sets, tend to find themselves standing alone, unwaveringly holding their position in order to effect their most important purposes -- to conserve resources, ensure longevity, and stabilize the business or society they are in. The analytical {\i power} of a {\i knowledge person} far exceeds that of any of the other value sets.\par
\par
When serious problems arise, a {\i knowledge person} becomes an essential resource. He has collected information by sheer will and desire and is able to deliver this information in a clear and balanced form.  A {\i knowledge person} will take the solutions presented by an {\i wisdom person} and formulate the solution down to the task level, understanding the interrelationship of all elements.\par
\par
The final answers that come from a {\i knowledge person} are solid. They are a long time coming, but when they do arrive, they are above reproach.\par
\par
{\b Challenges}\par
\par
{\i Knowledge people} frustrate {\i power people}. The results-oriented decisiveness of a {\i power person} is the opposite of a {\i knowledge person's} mentality.  {\i Knowledge people} also frustrate {\i love people}, but more typically {\i love people} frustrate them. The constant stirring up of opportunity, the typical lack of value of {\i love people} on completion of projects, and the lack of concern for details keeps {\i knowledge people} constantly feeling under informed and off balance. This generally leaves {\i knowledge people} feeling dismayed and frustrated.\par
\par
{\i Knowledge people} get along quite well with {\i wisdom people} since {\i wisdom people} have a high level of regard and need for the information which {\i knowledge people} have.  Since information and solutions fit together nicely, {\i knowledge people} serve {\i wisdom people} well by providing much needed analysis and amassed information that keeps the {\i wisdom person} on track.  This, in turn, leaves the {\i wisdom person} feeling confident of the solutions being implemented.\par
\par
{\i Knowledge people} have the hardest time as entrepreneurs. This is because they are most effective in an environment that needs management of complex, effective systems, and that requires balance and information. In the early stages of company development, until a company reaches $5 to $10 million in annual sales, {\i knowledge people} tend to overuse their organizational and managerial skills.  What are otherwise considered their strengths can, in fact, also become their weaknesses.\par
\par
A {\i knowledge person} who has strong {\i love person} characteristics, strong {\i wisdom person}, or {\i power person} traits can succeed admirably as a leader in a new enterprise. They must be willing, however, to keep their own dominant {\i knowledge person} trait in check until there is truly a need for it in the business.\par
\par
Since {\i knowledge people} are like {\i power people} in their inattention to team building, they often try to manage their companies or their departments far too long. They are detail-oriented people, concerned with knowing where everything is and if it is in its proper place and functioning to its full capability.  Preservation of an excellent status quo is more important to them than creation. The role of an entrepreneur is to create something out of nothing. For the most part, this is a complete antithesis of a {\i knowledge person's} natural inclination.\par
\par
{\i Knowledge people}, just like any other value set, must have strong partners or employees who provide the creative energy, the sales, the team building, and the drive to get results. Their difficulty lies in admitting it.  {\i Knowledge people} are prone to build an empire of supporters who, like themselves, gather, analyze and report information. They are generally appropriate and considerate bosses, but this is significantly different than the team building activities of a {\i love person} .\par
\par
A {\i knowledge person's} strengths is knowing that all of the information is accurate and available at their fingertips whenever needed.  A {\i knowledge person} is reluctant to make a decision except by omission or delay. {\i Knowledge people} are good at saying "no", which is a trait many people do not possess.  It is important, however, that they do not put situations at risk to avoid their general discomfort with moving forward when the situation calls for it.  This is usually understood by the other value sets and is considered one of their strengths.  When a {\i knowledge person} gets pressed, pushed to the wall, forced to make a decision or act against his analytical conclusions, he may simply disengage. {\i Knowledge people} who feel unduly pressured may judge others as being wrong and withdraw their trust. They may withhold information to regain control. They may also use that information to undermine others when the opportunity arises.  This would be considered a weakness within this value set.\par
\par
Because they dislike conflict, {\i knowledge people} will occasionally make promises they do not intend to keep. They may simply say a flat, unqualified "no" to everything, hoping that this simple act will be powerful enough to cause others to draw back and surrender. When {\i knowledge people} feel out of control, they may become aloof, untouchable, unreasonable, intractable, non-responsive, unavailable, busy, etc., due to what they perceive as an inordinate amount of unjustified pressure.\par
\par
{\i Knowledge people} generally outlast {\i power people}, {\i love people}, and {\i wisdom people} in a fight because they refuse to invest any energy in the battle until everyone else is exhausted. Their staying power, often considered strength, may also be a weakness when used at an inappropriate time.\par
\par
Some of the things you will hear {\i knowledge people} say:\par
\par
	"No.  It can't be done."\par
	"Get out of my face (space)."\par
	"Go ahead, if you really have to."\par
	"I told you..."\par
	"I'm studying that right now."\par
	"Not with my money."\par
	"We've never done it that way before."\par
	"Even if we succeed, it won't be enough."\par
\par
{\i Knowledge people} have extraordinary staying power. Their compulsion to be right or to be seen as being right does not allow them to easily admit failure. They keep trying, keep doing, and keep analyzing until often, by perseverance alone, they succeed where others would have failed long before.\par
\par
{\b {\i Cognitive Contributors -- (knowledge/wisdom people)}}\par
\par
{\i Cognitive contributors} are generally quiet, knowledgeable, resourceful, self-directed and steady people. Any business that needs creative solutions in a highly demanding, practical situation will appreciate the contributions of a {\i knowledge/wisdom person}. When the situation calls for reduction of good concepts to design and then the further reduction to documentation and quality control, the {\i knowledge/wisdom person} becomes irreplaceable.\par
\par
{\i Cognitive contributors} are rationally based, working from fact, provable systems and logical flow. This value set can rapidly assess a situation and come up with multiple solutions or systems to support the stated objectives. Once conceived, the ideas are analyzed, organized, proven on paper and perfected in documentation.\par
\par
The power of {\i cognitive contributors} in areas of product or system design echoes the strengths of the {\i love/knowledge person} in risky business situations. The {\i knowledge/wisdom person} is prone to carefully push the technological or systems horizons.  The {\i wisdom person} struggles to create the best possible end product, while for the {\i knowledge person}, half of the value set is constantly worrying about the details, picking up the unfinished and unresolved design flaws, challenging each step before and after it occurs, and assuring maximum likelihood of success.\par
\par
Because of their {\i knowledge} side, {\i cognitive contributors} will come up with true innovations that actually work. There is nothing more valuable to an engineering design team than unlimited innovation balanced by the ability to design such an innovation to perfection and ending up with documentation that carries all the way through production, testing and quality assurance.\par
\par
It is likely that {\i cognitive contributors} developed Calls and Puts in the stock brokerage arena. This is a prime example of innovation for the sake of risk reduction.\par
\par
{\i Cognitive contributors}, however, have a difficult time making decisions. Saying "no" without thought is not making a decision. Information provides evidence to create new solutions, and new solutions need proof, which can only be derived from further information, making the process loop endless. If you are a {\i cognitive contributor} and the president of a company (or head of a department), then your way to success is through attracting {\i love people} and {\i power people} with strong enough personalities to act on their own authority and not wait for you to make a decision. They also must be willing to tell you that some of the information you believe you "need" is not needed in order to get things done.\par
\par
When {\i cognitive contributors} go into their "no decision today" lock-up, there is little hope of getting them out of it. The {\i wisdom} side gets stubborn and isolates from others until "I can figure this out," and the {\i knowledge} side sets into motion a protracted data gathering and analysis cycle which "only I can manage." This posture is virtually impenetrable, unless a courageous {\i power person} simply puts himself at risk and takes unauthorized action, and a {\i love person} stays in the resulting fracas to help resolve relationships and keep everyone focused on the corporate goals.  Spontaneity for a {\i knowledge/wisdom person} is not a proposition for him.  Recognizing this as a weakness can help the {\i knowledge/wisdom person} surround himself with {\i love people} and {\i power people}.

Innovators are the solution creators in this world. They can always think of another approach. "There's got to be a better way," is more than their motto; it is pre-programmed ROM chips in their brain's reticular receiver. Innovators enjoy the challenge of a problem, especially on a large scale. They are problem solvers. They enjoy this so much that they hate to settle on any one solution --"There's got to be an even better way."  The statement, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" has no place in their awareness.\par
\par
The power of Innovators comes from their unwillingness to accept that there is anything they can't figure out. They are willing to put their ego at risk over and over again, staking their reputation that they will be able to come up with a plan, a solution, or an idea that will make things better.\par
\par
Then, to top things off, Innovators love to develop systems which insure the continuation of their plans.  These systems are the "monuments" of Innovator creativity just as much as a pyramid is the monument of a Builder.\par
\par
When everyone around them is in a panic, the Builder shouting orders, the Merchant whining or up selling, and the Banker preaching justice or patience, the Innovator tends to isolate, grab a computer or white board and set to work.\par
\par
They are highly creative in their approach to problem solving.  They inevitably are able to come at things from a new angle by adding elements, systems, or technologies that no one else has thought to add to the mix in order to achieve a true innovation.\par
\par
While the solutions and systems that Innovators create can be well founded and practical in concept, Innovators themselves are not highly practical in their approach. They do not make good implementers because they want to perfect everything before acting.  Taking action to them means coming up with another innovation, again delaying the implementation of their systems or new products.\par
\par
Innovators love to have people around. This is not for team building. This is an audience for their creativity and a way for them to bounce new ideas around.  They love to explore their latest ideas with people. They are so fascinated with each personally conceived "potential" solution that they want everyone to appreciate each and every subtlety.  Just when they have their audience convinced that this new solution is brilliant, they love to add, "Wait, what if we...?"\par
\par
Innovators may create problems just for the pleasure of working them out. Builders lean on Innovators but often leave them standing in the hallway, halfway through an explanation about a possible solution. Banker's constantly feed challenges to an Innovator's proposed strategies, keeping the Innovator charged with new problems to face. Merchants listen attentively to Innovators and lean on them constantly. This makes the Innovator feel "heard." Since the Merchant would never consider leaving an Innovator standing in the hallway, Innovators and Merchants often become great friends. Their brainstorming parties can be endless.  If left unchecked, they can actually become an endless drain of company resources.\par
\par
Innovators are invaluable. They create new products and put together systems to solve production and administrative problems. They are never defeated and are able to come up with new strategies and approaches when everyone else has given up. They enjoy this so much that they hate making decisions, and they occasionally add confusion to the system by always inventing a better way. Nothing is ever good enough, especially if it was conceived by someone else, or if the solution has been in place for more than a few months.\par
\par
Entrepreneur Innovators can be highly successful. They are the people that create the mousetrap that brings the world to their door. The problem is, they really believe the world will come to their door. And since they love the process of problem solving more than the process of actually building and selling something, as soon as one product or service idea is implemented, they are off to create another better solution.\par
\par
{\b Innovator Challenges}\par
\par
The most deadly sin of Innovators is their desperate need to continue perfecting a product or system long after it would fully serve its purpose. They get hooked on a specific solution or an interesting problem long after there has been a resolution to the problem.\par
\par
Active Innovators need a Builder in them or around them to insist that they settle on one solution and complete it. They need Merchants who will actually make someone else understand the value of the "solution" being sold.  And they need Bankers who will support them by completing the details, help them control costs and make profits.\par
\par
Innovators can be very stubborn people. They may refuse to be moved until they feel their solutions are perfected. And since they also value assessment very highly, they not only like to create a new solution, but they want to be the one who assesses its appropriateness, its correctness, its cleverness and its perfection. In fact, they are certain that no one else could ever understand all the subtlety and complexity of their solution so they hate to let others really get into it and explore, for fear they may have overlooked some small detail.\par
\par
Decisions for an Innovator become a marathon of adding one more consideration into the equation, testing its full ramifications and announcing, "I can see how that will fit." Then, when everyone else considers the decision to have been made, the Innovator may announce another level of considerations that must be explored prior to finalizing the decision. Innovators can be infuriating to Merchants and Builders who want to move on.\par
\par
Innovators will often be heard saying:\par
	"I think I can make that work."\par
	"We can do that."\par
	"It's not ready yet."\par
	"When I say it's finished, it's finished."\par
	"All we have left to do is..."\par
	"There's got to be a better way."\par
	"These things are never finished."\par
	"Wait. What if we...?"\par
        \par
Innovators are very perceptive and open to change if they see and understand the tensions they cause. They are willing to act differently if they can only see how the different action is going to produce better results. For this reason, Innovators and Builders make wonderful teammates. They tend to keep good balance in the drive for action versus the drive for perfection.\par
\par
The adaptiveness of Innovators is also highly prized by all other players. Innovators make little distinction between what problems they are asked to solve. The process of deriving a solution is sufficient to make them happy. Innovators are a key element in every business situation where change is occurring. Their resourcefulness brings new methods, tools, systems, and mechanisms to bear.  Innovators are always opening new opportunities for success.\par
\par
An opposite tendency is also true for many Innovators. They tend to become highly skilled at solving certain types of problems. Innovator Engineers, for instance, may be geniuses when designing a new electronic circuit, but more like absentminded professors when it comes to developing business solutions for their departments.\par
\par
When Innovators are out of control, they get stubborn. They look for another way to go around you or to make you reconsider. They reconsider and may go on the defensive and resist making a decision.  They may add another wrinkle to the equation to confuse you. They deny facts, challenge the validity or relevance of existing data, and refuse to take action, or sometimes just quit which may infuriate other value set groups.\par
\par
When all else fails, Innovators resort to interrogation. They like to confuse the issue with side questions and tangents. They know how to ask questions, which are more accusation than question. They know how to get under the skin of other people, asking questions that shame and embarrass, that show the ignorance of others, or simply make others feel ignorant or confused and inadequate.   Interrogation is just as powerful a strategy as the intimidation of Builders, the "Poor Me" victim caretaking role of Merchants, or the aloof, resistant, judgmental positioning of Bankers.\par
 \par
{\b Innovator/Builders}\par
\par
Innovator/Builders pay attention to thinking ahead, solving problems, knowing the best response, then taking action, making demands and causing desired results. Business situations that require lasting structures or systems to be built must have an Innovator/Builder power at the helm. Whether the requirement is to make something that is complex simple, or to take a simple system and make it more robust and responsive to current needs, the Innovator/Builder is the person for the job.\par
\par
Innovator/Builders conceive appropriate solutions and take immediate action. Implementing a solution to a problem is a rich form of reward for the Builder, and seeing a new product or system put into effect is the highest praise for an Innovator.   In the Innovator/Builder, we have a person who designs a monument and then builds it.\par
\par
These powerful personalities are good in isolation. They thrive on independence and chaff under someone else's management. If given a general idea of the problem to be solved or the monument to build, they will find a way to get it done.  Just give them their head and stand back. Without an open range to work in, their energy turns from creativity and action to clever evasion of restrictions, anger and invisibility. \par
\par
"What is he designing now?" and "Where is he now?" are questions sometimes asked about Innovator/Builders by the people around them.\par
\par
Innovator/Builders are not intimidated by much of anything except intimate relationships and speaking to crowds.  They tend to be resourceful, clever and inventive.  They are usually able to teach others (Innovator), and are powerful in command (Builder).  They derive their own solutions and put them into action without hesitation.\par
\par
In fast-changing environments, failing situations and extreme growth opportunities, Innovator/Builders are leaders.\par
\par
Innovator/Builders believe that they have the answer to every question and the power to do anything. Their Innovator value set develops one irrefutably valid solution after the next, and the Builder in them either pushes everyone out of the way while they implement the plan, or they pronounce their edict, "Just get it done."  They often add, "If you can't do it, I'll get someone who can.\par
\par
Since Builders are impatient with the world, they consider any teaching time to be "baby-sitting." Innovator/Builders are convinced they are self-sufficient. Since they are impatient, they also do not have time to be taught or challenged, so they may feel their ideas are the only ones with any merit.

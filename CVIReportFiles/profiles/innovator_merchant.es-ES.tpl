{\i Wisdom people} are the solution creators in this world. They can always think of another approach. "There's got to be a better way," is more than their motto; it is pre-programmed ROM chips in their brain's reticular receiver. {\i Wisdom people} enjoy the challenge of a problem, especially on a large scale. They are problem solvers. They enjoy this so much that they hate to settle on any one solution --"There's got to be an even better way."  The statement, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" has no place in their awareness.\par
\par
The power of {\i wisdom people} comes from their unwillingness to accept that there is anything they can't figure out. They are willing to put their ego at risk over and over again, staking their reputation that they will be able to come up with a plan, a solution, or an idea that will make things better.\par
\par
Then, to top things off, {\i wisdom people} love to develop systems which insure the continuation of their plans.  These systems are the "monuments" of {\i wisdom person's} creativity just as much as a pyramid is the monument of a {\i power person}.\par
\par
When everyone around them is in a panic, the {\i power person} shouting orders, the {\i love person} whining or up selling, and the {\i knowledge person} preaching justice or patience, the {\i wisdom person} tends to isolate, grab a computer or white board and set to work.\par
\par
They are highly creative in their approach to problem solving.  They inevitably are able to come at things from a new angle by adding elements, systems, or technologies that no one else has thought to add to the mix in order to achieve a true innovation.\par
\par
While the solutions and systems that {\i wisdom people} create can be well founded and practical in concept, {\i wisdom people} themselves are not highly practical in their approach. They do not make good implementers because they want to perfect everything before acting.  Taking action to them means coming up with another innovation, again delaying the implementation of their systems or new products.\par
\par
{\i Wisdom people} love to have people around. This is not for team building. This is an audience for their creativity and a way for them to bounce new ideas around.  They love to explore their latest ideas with people. They are so fascinated with each personally conceived "potential" solution that they want everyone to appreciate each and every subtlety.  Just when they have their audience convinced that this new solution is brilliant, they love to add, "Wait, what if we...?"\par
\par
{\i Wisdom people} may create problems just for the pleasure of working them out. {\i Power people} lean on {\i wisdom people} but often leave them standing in the hallway, halfway through an explanation about a possible solution. {\i Knowledge people} constantly feed challenges to a {\i wisdom person's} proposed strategies, keeping the {\i wisdom person} charged with new problems to face. {\i Love people} listen attentively to {\i wisdom people} and lean on them constantly. This makes the {\i wisdom person} feel "heard." Since the {\i love person} would never consider leaving a {\i wisdom person} standing in the hallway, {\i wisdom people} and {\i love people} often become great friends. Their brainstorming parties can be endless.  If left unchecked, they can actually become an endless drain of company resources.\par
\par
{\i Wisdom people} are invaluable. They create new products and put together systems to solve production and administrative problems. They are never defeated and are able to come up with new strategies and approaches when everyone else has given up. They enjoy this so much that they hate making decisions, and they occasionally add confusion to the system by always inventing a better way. Nothing is ever good enough, especially if it was conceived by someone else, or if the solution has been in place for more than a few months.\par
\par
Entrepreneur {\i wisdom people} can be highly successful. They are the people that create the mousetrap that brings the world to their door. The problem is, they really believe the world will come to their door. And since they love the process of problem solving more than the process of actually building and selling something, as soon as one product or service idea is implemented, they are off to create another better solution.\par
\par
{\b Challenges}\par
\par
The most deadly sin of {\i wisdom people} is their desperate need to continue perfecting a product or system long after it would fully serve its purpose. They get hooked on a specific solution or an interesting problem long after there has been a resolution to the problem.\par
\par
Active {\i wisdom people} need a {\i power person} in them or around them to insist that they settle on one solution and complete it. They need {\i love people} who will actually make someone else understand the value of the "solution" being sold.  And they need {\i knowledge people} who will support them by completing the details, help them control costs and make profits.\par
\par
{\i Wisdom people} can be very stubborn people. They may refuse to be moved until they feel their solutions are perfected. And since they also value assessment very highly, they not only like to create a new solution, but they want to be the one who assesses its appropriateness, its correctness, its cleverness and its perfection. In fact, they are certain that no one else could ever understand all the subtlety and complexity of their solution so they hate to let others really get into it and explore, for fear they may have overlooked some small detail.\par
\par
Decisions for a {\i wisdom person} become a marathon of adding one more consideration into the equation, testing its full ramifications and announcing, "I can see how that will fit." Then, when everyone else considers the decision to have been made, the Innovator may announce another level of considerations that must be explored prior to finalizing the decision. {\i Wisdom people} can be infuriating to {\i love people} and {\i power people} who want to move on.\par
\par
{\i Wisdom people} will often be heard saying:\par
	"I think I can make that work."\par
	"We can do that."\par
	"It's not ready yet."\par
	"When I say it's finished, it's finished."\par
	"All we have left to do is..."\par
	"There's got to be a better way."\par
	"These things are never finished."\par
	"Wait. What if we...?"\par
        \par
{\i Wisdom people} are very perceptive and open to change if they see and understand the tensions they cause. They are willing to act differently if they can only see how the different action is going to produce better results. For this reason, {\i wisdom people} and {\i power people} make wonderful teammates. They tend to keep good balance in the drive for action versus the drive for perfection.\par
\par
The adaptiveness of {\i wisdom people} is also highly prized by all other players. {\i Wisdom people} make little distinction between what problems they are asked to solve. The process of deriving a solution is sufficient to make them happy. {\i Wisdom people} are a key element in every business situation where change is occurring. Their resourcefulness brings new methods, tools, systems, and mechanisms to bear.  {\i Wisdom people} are always opening new opportunities for success.\par
\par
An opposite tendency is also true for many {\i wisdom people}. They tend to become highly skilled at solving certain types of problems. {\i Wisdom engineers}, for instance, may be geniuses when designing a new electronic circuit, but more like absentminded professors when it comes to developing business solutions for their departments.\par
\par
When {\i wisdom people} are out of control, they get stubborn. They look for another way to go around you or to make you reconsider. They reconsider and may go on the defensive and resist making a decision.  They may add another wrinkle to the equation to confuse you. They deny facts, challenge the validity or relevance of existing data, and refuse to take action, or sometimes just quit which may infuriate other value set groups.\par
\par
When all else fails, {\i wisdom people} resort to interrogation. They like to confuse the issue with side questions and tangents. They know how to ask questions, which are more accusation than question. They know how to get under the skin of other people, asking questions that shame and embarrass, that show the ignorance of others, or simply make others feel ignorant or confused and inadequate.   Interrogation is just as powerful a strategy as the intimidation of {\i power people}, the "Poor Me" victim caretaking role of {\i love people}, or the aloof, resistant, judgmental positioning of {\i knowledge people}.\par
\par
{\b {\i Creative Contributors-- (wisdom/love people)}}\par
\par
{\i Creative contributors} are problem solvers first, needing constant puzzles to solve but working well with others.  They see the big picture and lead from creativity. The power of a {\i wisdom/love person} is derived from an inexhaustible well of creativity. This creates a deep sense of optimism. If the {\i love person's} dream or vision is not being realized, the {\i wisdom person} can kick in and come up with appropriate solutions. When the {\i wisdom person's} solutions do not align perfectly with the {\i love person's} vision, a new vision is deftly formed which can encompass the solutions and systems that the {\i wisdom person} has conceived and still accomplish all of the basic values foreseen and desired by the {\i wisdom/love person}.\par
\par
This constant creativity makes the {\i wisdom/love person} an invaluable resource in companies where technologies are changing rapidly or competition puts new demands on the marketing and sales systems of the company. {\i Wisdom/love people} are often chosen as sales representatives. They can sell anything because they build relationships, understand their products, and know how to make them fit into a broad range of customer needs.\par
\par
{\i Creative contributors} are not put off by any problem of any magnitude. In fact, their sense of personal esteem is often based in the size, oppressiveness and worthiness of the problems they have before them. They look for opportunities to demonstrate their prowess at problem solving or at turning around difficult relationships that are at risk.\par
\par
{\i Wisdom/love people} like to be needed, either for their solutions and technologies or for their humanity, creativity and love. This need drives them to achieve relationships that are vision-based and growth-oriented, and to develop products or systems that enhance the richness of the relationships that are formed.\par
\par
{\i Wisdom/love people} are go-anywhere, do-anything kinds of people. They are even able to function for extended periods of time in remote if not somewhat isolated situations as long as the sense of connection and personal worth is maintained for the {\i love} side of the value set.  For the {\i wisdom person}, the absorption into the problem-solving aspects of any assignment will carry him a long way as long as there remains an opportunity to observe others evaluating and appraising his work once it is finished.\par
\par
{\i Wisdom/love people}, despite their ability to sustain themselves independently, thrive in a team environment. They are excellent team builders and great teachers.  They are masters of context and relevance. They not only are good at planning a curriculum and basing it in logic and reasonableness, but they consider the bigger picture.  They pay attention to their environment, entertainment, energy levels, and motivation.  They enjoy creating exciting and provocative learning situations.\par
\par
A {\i wisdom/love person} can be an incredible sales person or a powerful entrepreneur if he is balanced with just enough {\i power person} characteristics to actually complete the task at hand.\par
\par
However, {\i creative contributors}, unrestrained, can be unproductive for themselves and society. They can get lost in the rapture of exploring big picture considerations.  The {\i love person} is constantly thinking of new possibilities for projects and new adventures, and the {\i wisdom person} thrives on such challenges.\par
\par
{\i Wisdom people} hate to bring the process of problem solving to a close.  Solving problems is their highest form of pleasure, arguably valuing this game above sex and movies. So a {\i Wisdom/love person} keeps new things coming and everything that was stirred up before "in the works."  If you are a {\i wisdom/love person}, be certain that you surround yourself with high energy {\i power people} who will push you to "get it done" and a few levelheaded {\i knowledge people} who will help ground your ideas by asking you the kind of questions you may be unwilling to ask yourself.\par
\par
{\i Creative contributors} are constantly caught up in the seduction of new ideas, such as improving people systems. However, this concept and the strategy to create it are more important than the implementation itself to the {\i wisdom} side.\par
\par
{\i Wisdom/love people}, as company leaders, never quit selling and never quit solving the future. They sell themselves and others even when everyone has already agreed. There is little attention to detail, and since the next new idea takes 110% of all energy, things may be constantly left up in the air. {\i Wisdom/love people} tend to be able to keep so much energy swirling around them that they attract others.  {\i Power people} and {\i knowledge people} also enjoy a symbiotic relationship.\par
\par
But {\i wisdom/love people} may create as much disappointment as they do opportunity. No one can win from working with them for long, unless there are significant constraints in place, and a strong team of {\i power people} and {\i knowledge people} around them to enforce them. If you are a {\i wisdom/love person}, and you are reading this, you must have just a little {\i power person} or {\i knowledge person} in you. Make sure you nurture that part of yourself--NOW!!!

{\b How to Interview a Merchant/Banker}\par
\par
Merchant/Bankers are very adept socially with a Merchant's warmth and charm and a banker's formality and appropriateness They are extraordinary in their ability to learn everything from technical to human development and emotional intelligence. These people pride themselves on and their vision of the future, team building and communications abilities plus their knowledge and their practical approach.\par
\par
because their banker energy conserves energy and resources they are uniquely prepared to take on any new opportunities their Merchant values may uncover. They test and prove likelihood of success and position themselves for success well in advance. Yet they are spontaneous in their actions and socially gregarious at times.\par
\par
Merchant/Bankers may appear and actually be erratic at times, being overtly caring and gregarious at times, then suddenly cool and unemotional for long periods. When a person experiences the Merchant values first in these individuals, they may feel set up and disappointed by a conservative force and a negative response to new ideas, coming from the protective and thoughtful banker values later. Watch for a tendency to judge others harshly or to claim a victim position in situations.\par

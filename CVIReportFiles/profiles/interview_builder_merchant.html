{\b How to interview builder/Merchants}\par
\par
Builder/Merchants tend to be high energy people, task and relationship driven, with short-term focus and a limited ability to prioritize daily activities. They are spontaneous workers. Watch for lack of organization, unwillingness to perform repetitive tasks, emotional outbursts or defeats, lack of appreciation for systems and procedures. These individuals may also have some difficulty being consistent, and they may create chaos and confusion when they shift between their builder (do it now) values and their Merchant (let's be friends) values.\par
\par
Watch for honesty in admitting weaknesses and specific times when this individual began to acknowledge and work to develop their Innovator and banker skills (creating and honoring systems and being organized, careful and consistent). These people tend to lead by work ethic and effort, plus love and team building-emotionally based. Watch for maturity related to planning, consistency and clear-mindedness.\par

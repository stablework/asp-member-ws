<p>The Core Values Index holds a wealth of knowledge about human beings, how we operate and what causes us to choose one behavior over another. The Core Values Handbook provides Information about the innate nature of people – fundamental new knowledge upon which a high value human life can be built.</p>
                

<p>The Core Values Index&trade; (CVI&trade;) characterizes and measures each person’s Real Core Values Nature&trade;. This is the essential self that Abraham Maslow asserted is the innate unchanging nature in each of us that causes us to want to make our unique contribution. It is that part of us that determines where we fit, where we can each make our highest and best contribution. Team building, conflict resolution, leadership training, management, restructuring departments, and businesses- every type of engagement between individuals is dramatically improved when the Core Values Index&trade; is at the center.</p>

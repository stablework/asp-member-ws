  Let's face it, everyone has their weak spots, their undermining thoughts, their occasional slips of logic, and ineffective behavioral responses that are embarrassing, ineffective, and sometimes destructive to ourselves and others.
</p>
<p>
  We have learned that most of these Achilles Heel kinds of mistakes in behavior and attitude  most often come out of our most dominant Core Value Energies, out of our most precious and important human energy. As Dan Cox likes to say, "We are most vulnerable when we are operating in our most dominant Core Value Energy."
</p>
<p>
  Bankers have vulnerable heels in their core value, knowledge. Builders lose their strength when they most need their core value, power. Love fails the best of us merchants just when relationships are most in need of thoughtful responses and a little more maturity in our interactions. Innovators, who are most needed for their wisdom and their constant effort to understand and provide solutions, find themselves in a loop of logic and intuitive blocks that make the best of us look a little foolish at times.
</p>
<p>
  This may not be the most fun topic for any of us, but it is one that may help us most to master our own lives and create our greatest contribution. One admonishment; be very slow to say to yourself, "this doesn't apply to me." The only way any of us humans make progress is when we allow ourselves to feel uncomfortable with the way we are choosing to show up. As a last resort to keep yourself honest ask your spouse or other Core Relationship&trade; people, whether you occasionally display a little Achilles Heel in your daily activities.
</p>
<p>
  Your dominant Core Value Energy is, <strong class="qTitle">Banker</strong>. If you have more than 26 points of this Core Value Energy, you are almost certain to wrestle with the following challenges on a regular basis. If you have 19-25 points, you are likely to have some of the challenges.
</p>
<p>
When <strong class="qTitle">bankers</strong> slip quietly out of their contribution mode into the personality driven 'taking
	and getting' mode, it is often caused by their commitment to <i>knowledge</i> as the most essential human energy in life. They have a drive to be an expert,
	to have the <i>knowledge</i> that is most needed in a given situation. They	expect this of themselves and hope that others find this to be true most of the	time.
</p>
<p>
	The Achilles Heel arises when their peers or higher authorities in business do not ask for
	the <i>knowledge</i> the <i>banker</i> has. Or an important leader, having
	asked for the facts, procrastinates reading the reports until it is too late.
	Or, having read the information the <i>banker's </i>associates do not make a
	different decision than they previously would have made without the information.
	Or, having made the right and better decision, they fail to take action and get
	the better result that the <i>banker's knowledge</i> could have assured.
</p>
<p>
	When the <i>banker's</i>
	efforts to provide essential information for better success do not lead to
	greater success, the <i>banker</i> tends to feel anxious that the <i>knowledge</i>
	they had was not sufficient, not good enough, not thorough enough, not detailed
	enough. They tend to respond to the anxiety by trying harder, building a more
	detailed report. This anxiety works like the dimmer switch in your dining room
	at home.
</p>
<p>
	When the dimmer	switch is fully open and there is no anxiety the <i>knowledge</i> energy is
	free to flow into the room bringing light into the darkness. When the <i>banker's</i>
	anxiety gets excited the dimmer switch begins to restrict the flow of his <i>knowledge</i>
	Core Value Energy. This restricts the free flow of <i>knowledge</i> into the
	situation causing further failure to make an optimal contribution of <i>knowledge</i>
	into the room.
</p>
<p>
	This effort
	causes an unconscious escalation of the <i>knowledge</i> energy, trying to
	force it into strong influence and participation. The effect is usually that
	people begin resisting this effort. They begin to feel worn down by the <i>knowledge</i>
	person's constant statements of 'the obvious.‚Äù They tend to become black and
	white, wrong or right thinkers building resentment among others in the process.
</p>
<p>
	The tendency is
	to continue to try to be the <i>knowledge</i> in the situation, long past the
	time when they would have benefitted from and been more effective by shifting
	into one of the lesser held Core Value Energies.

</p>
<p>
	Having failed
	to listen to their anxiety, they find themselves judging others as being
	unworthy of 'my' <i>knowledge</i>. The <i>banker </i>may become very aloof and
	unavailable emotionally, socially and even in functional business situations.
	The black and white thinking causes others to quit asking for the <i>
		banker's
		knowledge
	</i>. This causes a fear based response that is either total
	withdrawal and withholding of information or a pontificating of facts and
	information in a manner and at a time when this information is neither
	requested or appreciated.
</p>
<p>
	The best
	response for a <i>banker</i> who finds himself in this situation is to remember
	one simple truth, one simple fact... The most ignorant thing a person can do is
	to continue to be the presence of <i>knowledge</i> in a situation that needs
	more <i>power, love</i> or <i>wisdom</i>. Shift to one of these other essential
	human energies and get back into a contributing mode.
</p>
<p>
	The smart
	(awake and conscious) <i>knowledge</i> person shifts to one of these other
	essential human energies and gets back into a contributing mode.

  Let's face it, everyone has their weak spots, their undermining thoughts, their occasional slips of logic, and ineffective behavioral responses that are embarrassing, ineffective, and sometimes destructive to ourselves and others.
</p>
<p>
  We have learned that most of these Achilles Heel kinds of mistakes in behavior and attitude  most often come out of our most dominant Core Value Energies, out of our most precious and important human energy. As Dan Cox likes to say, "We are most vulnerable when we are operating in our most dominant Core Value Energy."
</p>
<p>
  Bankers have vulnerable heels in their core value, knowledge. Builders lose their strength when they most need their core value, power. Love fails the best of us merchants just when relationships are most in need of thoughtful responses and a little more maturity in our interactions. Innovators, who are most needed for their wisdom and their constant effort to understand and provide solutions, find themselves in a loop of logic and intuitive blocks that make the best of us look a little foolish at times.
</p>
<p>
  This may not be the most fun topic for any of us, but it is one that may help us most to master our own lives and create our greatest contribution. One admonishment; be very slow to say to yourself, "this doesn't apply to me." The only way any of us humans make progress is when we allow ourselves to feel uncomfortable with the way we are choosing to show up. As a last resort to keep yourself honest ask your spouse or other Core Relationship&trade; people, whether you occasionally display a little Achilles Heel in your daily activities.
</p>
<p>
  Your dominant Core Value Energy is, <strong class="qTitle">Banker</strong>. If you have more than 26 points of this Core Value Energy, you are almost certain to wrestle with the following challenges on a regular basis. If you have 19-25 points, you are likely to have some of the challenges.

  When builders find themselves frustrated and sliding down the slippery slope toward intimidation, is it often caused by their strong commitment to being the power in the room. They have a deep emotional sense that they should be able to make things happen from their own power. They are required by their value structure to maintain faith in their intuition, in the sufficiency of their power and in their confidence that they will always know what to do next, so they can take fearless action and created dramatic instantaneous results.
</p>
<p>
  The Achilles Heel becomes active when the builder finds himself making more mistakes than usual, creating more fires that he is able to put out, facing business or personal obstacles that require more than his own power to surmount. The shift to intimidation happens when someone in authority decides this builder is not allowed to make intuitive decisions or take intuitive unchecked action autonomously.
</p>
<p>
  When the builder power is not causing a positive change, making a positive contribution, their faith in their own power begins to be diminished. They started feeling anxious that maybe their power is insufficient, that their intuition may be faulty. This causes an increasing anxiety. This anxiety works like the dimmer switch in your dining room at home.
</p>
<p>
  When the dimmer switch is fully open and there is no anxiety the power energy is free to flow into the room and bring light to the darkness. When the anxiety gets excited the dimmer switch begins to restrict the flow of power Core Value Energy into the situation causing further failure to make the ideal contribution of power into the room.
</p>
<p>
  The effect is escalation of human power energy, trying to force it into strong influence and participation. The effect is usually that people begin resisting this effort. They begin to feel overwhelmed and not regarded as individuals. They get the sense that they have no options. They tend to believe the power person is not interested in knowledge, wisdom or love and relationships. Power people (and anyone who is operating in their power mode) tend to become â€˜Just do it now" people, frustrated by a sense of urgency and their own lack of impact.
</p>
<p>
  The tendency is to continue to try to be the power in the situation, long past the time then they would have benefitted and been more effective by shifting into one of their lower capacity Core Value Energies.

  When the builder power person has failed to listen to his anxiety, he finds himself judging others as being unworthy of my power. The builder may become very intimidating and dismissive, judging others to be unworthy as reliable doers. This impatience and intimidation can become very controlling, causing others to give in for the moment, looking for chances to undermine the builder's future effectiveness. This causes a fear based response in the builder that is either total withdrawal or total control through micromanagement and taking over.
</p>
<p>
  The best response for a builder who finds himself in this situation is to remember one simple truth, one simple fact... The most impotent thing a person can do is to continue to be the presence of power in a situation that needs more knowledge, love or wisdom.
</p>
<p>
  The smart power person shifts to one of these other essential human energies and gets back into a contributing mode.

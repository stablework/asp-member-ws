            <p>There’s billions of dollars being spent on training, assessments, and hiring systems today yet the 80/20 rule is still exists.  This effort is good but seems to get us to the 80/20 rule vs. defy it.  Everyone understands the right people in the right seats is the key to growth and it couldn’t be more important than in today’s economy to get this right.</p> 

            <p>Jim Collins foundational business book “Good to Great” states:</p>

            <p>“The moment you feel the need to tightly manage someone you’ve made a hiring mistake”.  We’ve all felt this and probably feel it right now.</p>

            <p>“Letting the wrong people hang around is unfair to all the right people, as they inevitably find themselves compensating for the inadequacies of the wrong people”.   The cost of one wrong hire negatively ripples through the organization.</p>

            <p><strong class="qtBold">What does the team your most familiar with that are in the same position look like right now?</strong> Think only in terms of performance and productivity vs wether we like them or their important.</p>

            <p>Now think of the worst performer, now think of the next best top performer, now the next worst and so forth.  When you honestly go through this process you will find that 20% truly produce 80% of the output while 80% of the team produces 20%.</p>
            <p>This trend is supported by the research found by the Gallup Management Journal revealing a few important realities.</p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>American businesses are operating at one third of their capacity.</li>
            <li>Actively disengaged employees cost the American economy up to $350 billion per year in lost productivity.</li>
            <li>71% of the Americans who go to work every day aren’t engaged in their role.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>This proves that behavior and personality assessments don’t work in the hiring process to get only Top Performers.</p>
             
            <p>Our technology is different and is proven in over 700 companies to be able to flip the 80/20 rule in any position, industry, or company.  It simply works because it eliminate human bias by putting an accurate objective screen at the top of the hiring process.  In this way the hiring managers only interview people who have the unchanging wiring within them that matches the unique tasks and functions of a specific companies position.</p>

            <p class="centertext">
            <img src="http://www.taylorprotocols.com/images/HiringFlow.png" alt="Right Person/Right Job Hiring Flow" width="713" height="480"></img>
            </p>

            <p class="tpptitle">The foundational difference is found in what an assessment measures</p>
            <p>At the core of our technology is the assessment you just took called the Core Values Index.</p>
            <p>It characterizes and quantifies what Abraham Maslow called the unchanging innate nature of a person that inscribes where a person can make their highest and most productive contribution to the world.</p>
            <p>The industry standard metric used to measure wether an assessment changes over time is <u>repeat score reliability.</u> The CVI has proven in <strong class="qtBold">longetudinal studies</strong> to have the highest at over 94% year after year.  It provides a clear and useful picture of the innate, unchanging nature of an individual. This is much different then personality and behavioral assessments.</p>
            <p><strong class="qtBold">How can it be so accurate and take only 10 minutes?</strong></p>
            <p>It’s the only human assessment that uses strategic and tactical values in a forced choice format, to gain unequivocal insight into the innate nature of the person. Behavioral and psychological tools are by their nature fraught with problems of misrepresentation by the users, who tend to create false positives when completing the respective instruments.</p>
            <p>This is made possible by the construct of the instruments themselves and the use of context loaded questions. It is also encouraged by the common requirement to disclose negative, or perceived to be negative information about one’s self. Since the CVI is comprised of only positive values, no such negative disclosure is required, and no context is provided.</p>
            <p><strong class="qtBold">We have the only human assessment process that provides 94% repeat score reliability, year after year.</strong> Other assessments typically provide reliability between 60% and 80%. This is several orders of magnitude improvement—attesting to the fact that we are capturing the innate unchanging nature of people. </p>
            <p class="centertext"><strong class="qtBold">This is why the CVI is the only assessment that should be used as a pre-screening tool for employment application processes.</strong></p>

            <p class="tpptitle">How We Create a Top Performer Profile</p>
            <p>The usual subjective process of hiring new employees includes reading through resumes, performing phone interviews, conducting endless personal interviews, and gambling on the hope that the new candidate will be similar to your current top performers.</p>
            <p>However, the Top Performer Profile (TPP) is the first Employment Pre-Selection tool that acts as a true objective screen at the very beginning of the hiring process. The TPP&trade; is based on each company’s current top performers’ outputs and profits, and it is used to pre-select future top performers from incoming candidates.</p>
            <p><strong class="qtBold">Steps to creating a Top Performer Profile:</strong></p>
            <p><strong class="qtBold">Rate Current Players</strong> | Have client grade current team in the position rating each person on measured performance as an A,B,C, or D player.</p>
            <p><strong class="qtBold">Everyone Takes the CVI</strong> | We have everyone currently in that position take the Core Values Index (CVI)</p>
            <p><strong class="qtBold">We Create A Specific Profile for the Position</strong> | We interview our client to discover the actual tasks and functions of the position.</p>
            <p>We have the only medical grade image processing algorithms applied to a noisy database of core values scores that allow us to deduce the core value profile of top performers in a given position, in a given company, at any given time. This creates the finished Top Performer Profile (TPP) for our clients – A tight range of score of 10 measurement points which include the four core values and six types.</p>
            <p class="centertext">
            <img src="http://www.taylorprotocols.com/images/TPP.png" alt="Right Person/Right Job TPP"></img>
            </p>
            <p>The profile screens out over 90% of people who aren’t wired to actually do the tasks of the position while screening in those who are wired to be top performers.</p>

            <p class="tpptitle">It’s not just for hiring more people</p>
            <p>Having TPP’s for every position in a company enables the executive team to compare everyone in the organization to every position.  This gives accurate insight into where to move people around within the organization enabling good people that are underperforming to find the right role where they instantly become Top Performers.  You have a real time audit always in place making sure everyone is positioned to do their best work that matches who they are.</p>
            <p class="centertext">
            <img src="http://www.taylorprotocols.com/images/80-20.png" alt="Right Person/Right Job Human Capital Audit"></img>
            </p>

            <p class="tpptitle">Implementation is simple and causes no distractions</p>
            <p>We don’t change our clients hiring methods, instead we change who hiring managers allow to be interviewed.  We ensure only people wired to be highly productive in the tasks of your companies specific positions are selected for interviews.</p>
            <p>This actually immediately eliminates a lot of time and effort that used to be spent sifting through applications and resume’s in the old subjective process in deciding who to interview.</p>
            <p><strong class="qtBold">How Our Clients Use It:</strong></p>
            <p><strong class="qtBold">Clients attract candidates who are compared to the Top Performer Profile</strong> | The client then advertises for positions as they normally do, and those who submit a resume are sent the CVI. All candidates and their scores automatically show up in our website, that only our clients have access to. Every score is filtered through our clients specific TPP revealing who has the specific wiring that matches the position.</p>
            <p><strong class="qtBold">The hiring manager only interviews highly recommended candidates </strong> | This eliminates the human bias that creates the 80/20 rule.</p>
            <p><strong class="qtBold">Clients use their same interviewing methods</strong> | We don’t change their system, we only change who they allow in front of them.</p>
            <p>*We offer a facilitated process if a company has only a few or no one in the position they want to hire people for.</p>
            <p>“No company can grow revenues consistently faster than its ability to get enough of the right people to implement that growth and still become a great company. If your growth rate in revenues consistently outpaces your growth rate in people, you simply will not- indeed cannot-build a great company.”  - David Packard, cofounder hewlett-Packard (Book “Good to Great”)</p>

                    The secret is not to learn how to have fun and joy at work; the secret is to do
                    work that is naturally engaging to <em>who you are</em> and <em>what you are</em>,
                    so you know that you are making your highest and best contribution. This allows
                    you to experience real joy naturally as part of your work-life. This is what Abraham
                    Maslow called "peak experiences." Sometimes this makes the <em>right job</em> downright
                    fun.

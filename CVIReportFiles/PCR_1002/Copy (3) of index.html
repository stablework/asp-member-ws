<h2>Our Top Performer Technology</h2>
<p>Billions of dollars are spent on training, assessing and hiring systems today. Everyone understands how having the right people in the right seats is the key to growth, but actually finding the right people is allusive and difficult. In today’s economy it is more important than EVER to get this right.</p>


<p class="listtitle">This trend is supported by research in the Gallup Management Journal revealing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>American businesses are operating at one-third of their capacity.</li>
<li>Disengaged employees cost the American economy up to $350 billion per year in lost productivity.</li>
<li>71% of American workers aren’t engaged in their roles.</li>
</ul>

<p class="tpptitle">What about your business? </p>
<p>For a moment, set aside character and relationships, and consider the people you work with ONLY in terms of their performance and productivity.
</p>
<p class="indtext">Who is the top performer?<br />
Who is the next best top performer?<br />
Who is the worst performer? <br />
Who is the next worst top performer?</p>


<p>In the hundreds of businesses we have worked with over the years we have discovered the universal truth that 20% really are doing the majority often over 80% of the work. The cost of one wrong hire rippling its negativity through your entire organization. Now, what if you could flip The “80/20 Rule” on it’s ear within any business, industry or team with an objective screening at the top of the hiring/recruiting process? </p>

<p>“The moment you feel the need to tightly manage someone, you’ve made a hiring mistake.  We’ve all felt this and probably feel it right now.”
<br />-Jim Collins, Good to Great</p>

<p>Collins also wrote, “Letting the wrong people hang around is unfair to all the right people, as they inevitably find themselves compensating for the inadequacies of the wrong people.” </p>

<p class="tpptitle">So how can YOU do things differently?</p>
 
<p>The Wired Success technology is truly different. </p>

<p>We start with the most accurate human assessment ever created, the Core Values Index&trade;</p>

<p class="listtitle">Here is what makes the CVI different than every other assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li>94% (RSR) Repeat Score Reliability in longitudinal studies - RSR is the metric industry standard used to measure how accurate tests like this are, and the CVI has the highest of all tests of its kind.</li>
<li>Clear, Useful Picture – The CVI characterizes and quantifies what Abraham Maslow called the unchanging, innate nature of a person. It highlights how a person can make their highest and most productive contribution to the world. This is much different than personality and behavioral assessments.</li>
<li>All positive – Participants in most other behavioral and psychological tools are often asked to disclose negative information. For example, “If someone spills a glass of water, do you do nothing? Tell someone else to clean it up?” Those answers can be perceived as negative, so those tests are fraught with false positives because the users will be tempted to misrepresent their real selves. Since the CVI is comprised of only positive, non-contextual values, no such negative disclosure is required.</li>
<li>10 Minutes – It’s the shortest assessment on the market, saving individuals and companies valuable time in discovering how to motivate profits and positive change. Most other tests take at least an hour. It’s the only human assessment that uses strategic and tactical values in a forced choice format, so it takes less time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second piece of our technology is our Top Performer Profile (TPP) process and software.  The TPP is the first scientifically developed system for analyzing current performance and task by task level information to accurately predict future top performers.  We have proven this scientific approach with hundreds of companies; their success and profits speak for themselves. 
</p>
<p>“No company can grow revenues consistently faster than its ability to get enough of the right people to implement that growth and still become a great company. If your growth rate in revenues consistently outpaces your growth rate in people, you simply will not- indeed cannot-build a great company.”<br />-Hewlett-Packard co-founder, David Packard “Good to Great”
</p>
<p class="tpptitle">It’s not just for hiring people.</p>
<p>Having “Top Performer Profiles” for every position in a company enables the executive team to compare everyone in the organization to every position.  This gives accurate insight into where to move people around within the organization enabling good people that are underperformed to find the right role where they instantly become Top Performers.  You have a real time audit always in place making sure everyone is positioned to do their best work that matches who they are.
